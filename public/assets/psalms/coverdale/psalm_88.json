  "text": "O LORD God of my salvation, I have cried day and night before thee:\nO let my prayer enter into thy presence, incline thine ear unto my calling; 2 For my soul is full of trouble,\nand my life draweth nigh unto the grave. 3 I am counted as one of them that go down into the pit,\nand I am even as a man that hath no strength; 4 Cast off among the dead, like unto them that are slain, and lie in the grave,\nwho are out of remembrance, and are cut away from thy hand. 5 Thou hast laid me in the lowest pit,\nin a place of darkness, and in the deep. 6 Thine indignation lieth hard upon me,\nand thou hast vexed me with all thy storms. 7 Thou hast put away mine acquaintance far from me,\nand made me to be abhorred of them. 8 I am so fast in prison\nthat I cannot get forth. 9 My sight faileth for very trouble;\nLORD, I have called daily upon thee, I have stretched forth my hands unto thee. 10 Dost thou show wonders among the dead?\nor shall the dead rise up again, and praise thee? 11 Shall thy loving-kindness be showed in the grave?\nor thy faithfulness in destruction? 12 Shall thy wondrous works be known in the dark?\nand thy righteousness in the land where all things are forgotten? 13 Unto thee have I cried, O LORD;\nand early shall my prayer come before thee. 14 LORD, why abhorrest thou my soul,\nand hidest thou thy face from me? 15 I am in misery, and like unto him that is at the point to die;\neven from my youth up, thy terrors have I suffered with a troubled mind. 16 Thy wrathful displeasure goeth over me,\nand the fear of thee hath undone me. 17 They came round about me daily like water,\nand compassed me together on every side. 18 My lovers and friends hast thou put away from me,\nand hid mine acquaintance out of my sight. 19 Glory be to the Father, and tó the Són,\nand to the Hóly Ghóst; 20 As it was in the beginning, † is now, and éver sháll be,\nworld wíthout énd. Amen. Evening Prayer",
