  "text": "THE LORD, even the Most Mighty God, hath spoken,\nand called the world, from the rising up of the sun unto the going down thereof. 2 Out of Sion hath God appeared\nin perfect beauty. 3 Our God shall come, and shall not keep silence;\nthere shall go before him a consuming fire, and a mighty tempest shall be stirred up round about him. 4 He shall call the heaven from above,\nand the earth, that he may judge his people. 5 Gather my saints together unto me;\nthose that have made a covenant with me with sacrifice. 6 And the heavens shall declare his righteousness;\nfor God is Judge himself. 7 Hear, O my people, and I will speak;\nI myself will testify against thee, O Israel; for I am God, even thy God. 8 I will not reprove thee because of thy sacrifices;\nas for thy burnt-offerings, they are alway before me. 9 I will take no bullock out of thine house,\nnor he-goats out of thy folds. 10 For all the beasts of the forest are mine,\nand so are the cattle upon a thousand hills. 11 I know all the fowls upon the mountains,\nand the wild beasts of the field are in my sight. 12 If I be hungry, I will not tell thee;\nfor the whole world is mine, and all that is therein. 13 Thinkest thou that I will eat bulls’ flesh,\nand drink the blood of goats? 14 Offer unto God thanksgiving,\nand pay thy vows unto the Most Highest. 15 And call upon me in the time of trouble;\nso will I hear thee, and thou shalt praise me. 16 But unto the ungodly saith God,\nWhy dost thou preach my laws, and takest my covenant in thy mouth; 17 Whereas thou hatest to be reformed,\nand hast cast my words behind thee? 18 When thou sawest a thief, thou consentedst unto him;\nand hast been partaker with the adulterers. 19 Thou hast let thy mouth speak wickedness,\nand with thy tongue thou hast set forth deceit. 20 Thou sattest and spakest against thy brother;\nyea, and hast slandered thine own mother’s son. 21 These things hast thou done, and I held my tongue, and thou thoughtest wickedly, that I am even such a one as thyself;\nbut I will reprove thee, and set before thee the things that thou hast done. 22 O consider this, ye that forget God,\nlest I pluck you away, and there be none to deliver you. 23 Whoso offereth me thanks and praise, he honoreth me;\nand to him that ordereth his way aright, will I show the salvation of God. 24 Glory be to the Father, and tó the Són,\nand to the Hóly Ghóst; 25 As it was in the beginning, † is now, and éver sháll be,\nworld wíthout énd. Amen.",
