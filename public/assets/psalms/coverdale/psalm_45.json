  "text": "MY heart overfloweth with a good matter; I speak the things which I have made concerning the King.\nMy tongue is the pen of a ready writer. 2 Thou art fairer than the children of men;\nfull of grace are thy lips, because God hath blessed thee forever. 3 Gird thee with thy sword upon thy thigh, O thou Most Mighty,\naccording to thy worship and renown. 4 Good luck have thou with thine honor:\nride on, because of the word of truth, of meekness, and righteousness; and thy right hand shall teach thee terrible things. 5 Thy arrows are very sharp in the heart of the King’s enemies,\nand the people shall be subdued unto thee. 6 Thy seat, O God, endureth forever;\nthe scepter of thy kingdom is a right scepter. 7 Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated iniquity;\nwherefore God, even thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows. 8 All thy garments smell of myrrh, aloes, and cassia;\nout of the ivory palaces, whereby they have made thee glad. 9 Kings’ daughters are among thy honorable women;\nupon thy right hand doth stand the queen in a vesture of gold, wrought about with divers colors. 10 Harken, O daughter, and consider; incline thine ear;\nforget also thine own people, and thy father’s house. 11 So shall the King have pleasure in thy beauty;\nfor he is thy Lord, and worship thou him. 12 And the daughter of Tyre shall be there with a gift;\nlike as the rich also among the people shall make their supplication before thee. 13 The King’s daughter is all glorious within;\nher clothing is of wrought gold. 14 She shall be brought unto the King in raiment of needlework:\nthe virgins that be her fellows shall bear her company, and shall be brought unto thee. 15 With joy and gladness shall they be brought,\nand shall enter into the King’s palace. 16 Instead of thy fathers, thou shalt have children,\nwhom thou mayest make princes in all lands. 17 I will make thy Name to be remembered from one generation to another;\ntherefore shall the people give thanks unto thee, world without end. 18 Glory be to the Father, and tó the Són,\nand to the Hóly Ghóst; 19 As it was in the beginning, † is now, and éver sháll be,\nworld wíthout énd.
