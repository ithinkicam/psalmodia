  "text": "O HEAR ye this, all ye people;\nponder it with your ears, all ye that dwell in the world; 2 High and low, rich and poor,\none with another. 3 My mouth shall speak of wisdom,\nand my heart shall muse of understanding. 4 I will incline mine ear to the parable,\nand show my dark speech upon the harp. 5 Wherefore should I fear in the days of evil,\nwhen wickedness at my heels compasseth me round about? 6 There be some that put their trust in their goods,\nand boast themselves in the multitude of their riches. 7 But no man may deliver his brother,\nnor give a ransom unto God for him, 8 (For it cost more to redeem their souls,\nso that he must let that alone forever;) 9 That he shall live alway,\nand not see the grave. 10 For he seeth that wise men also die and perish together,\nas well as the ignorant and foolish, and leave their riches for other. 11 And yet they think that their houses shall continue forever, and that their dwelling-places shall endure from one generation to another;\nand call the lands after their own names. 12 Nevertheless, man being in honor abideth not,\nseeing he may be compared unto the beasts that perish; 13 This their way is very foolishness;\nyet their posterity praise their saying. 14 They lie in the grave like sheep; death is their shepherd; and the righteous shall have dominion over them in the morning:\ntheir beauty shall consume in the sepulchre, and have no abiding. 15 But God hath delivered my soul from the power of the grave;\nfor he shall receive me. 16 Be not thou afraid, though one be made rich,\nor if the glory of his house be increased; 17 For he shall carry nothing away with him when he dieth,\nneither shall his pomp follow him. 18 For while he lived, he counted himself an happy man;\nand so long as thou doest well unto thyself, men will speak good of thee. 19 He shall follow the generation of his fathers,\nand shall never see light. 20 Man that is in honor but hath no understanding\nis compared unto the beasts that perish. 21 Glory be to the Father, and tó the Són,\nand to the Hóly Ghóst; 22 As it was in the beginning, † is now, and éver sháll be,\nworld wíthout énd. Amen. THE TENTH DAY Morning Prayer.",
