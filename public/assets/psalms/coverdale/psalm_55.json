  "text": "HEAR my prayer, O God,\nand hide not thyself from my petition. 2 Take heed unto me, and hear me,\nhow I mourn in my prayer, and am vexed; 3 The enemy crieth so, and the ungodly cometh on so fast;\nfor they are minded to do me some mischief, so maliciously are they set against me. 4 My heart is disquieted within me,\nand the fear of death is fallen upon me. 5 Fearfulness and trembling are come upon me,\nand an horrible dread hath overwhelmed me. 6 And I said, O that I had wings like a dove!\nfor then would I flee away, and be at rest. 7 Lo, then would I get me away far off,\nand remain in the wilderness. 8 I would make haste to escape,\nbecause of the stormy wind and tempest. 9 Destroy their tongues, O Lord, and divide them;\nfor I have spied unrighteousness and strife in the city. 10 Day and night they go about within the walls thereof:\nmischief also and sorrow are in the midst of it. 11 Wickedness is therein;\ndeceit and guile go not out of her streets. 12 For it is not an open enemy that hath done me this dishonor;\nfor then I could have borne it; 13 Neither was it mine adversary that did magnify himself against me;\nfor then peradventure I would have hid myself from him; 14 But it was even thou, my companion,\nmy guide, and mine own familiar friend. 15 We took sweet counsel together,\nand walked in the house of God as friends. 16 Let death come hastily upon them, and let them go down alive into the pit;\nfor wickedness is in their dwellings, and among them. 17 As for me, I will call upon God,\nand the LORD shall save me. 18 In the evening, and morning, and at noonday will I pray, and that instantly;\nand he shall hear my voice. 19 It is he that hath delivered my soul in peace from the battle that was against me;\nfor there were many that strove with me. 20 Yea, even God, that endureth forever, shall hear me, and bring them down;\nfor they will not turn, nor fear God. 21 He laid his hands upon such as be at peace with him,\nand he brake his covenant. 22 The words of his mouth were softer than butter, having war in his heart;\nhis words were smoother than oil, and yet be they very swords. 23 O cast thy burden upon the LORD, and he shall nourish thee,\nand shall not suffer the righteous to fall forever. 24 And as for them,\nthou, O God, shalt bring them into the pit of destruction. 25 The bloodthirsty and deceitful men shall not live out half their days:\nnevertheless, my trust shall be in thee, O Lord. 26 Glory be to the Father, and tó the Són,\nand to the Hóly Ghóst; 27 As it was in the beginning, † is now, and éver sháll be,\nworld wíthout énd. Amen. THE ELEVENTH DAY Morning Prayer.",
