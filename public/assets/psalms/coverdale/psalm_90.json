  "text": "LORD, thou hast been our refuge,\nfrom one generation to another. 2 Before the mountains were brought forth, or ever the earth and the world were made,\nthou art God from everlasting, and world without end. 3 Thou turnest man to destruction;\nagain thou sayest, Come again, ye children of men. 4 For a thousand years in thy sight are but as yesterday when it is past,\nand as a watch in the night. 5 As soon as thou scatterest them they are even as a sleep;\nand fade away suddenly like the grass. 6 In the morning it is green, and groweth up;\nbut in the evening it is cut down, dried up, and withered. 7 For we consume away in thy displeasure,\nand are afraid at thy wrathful indignation. 8 Thou hast set our misdeeds before thee;\nand our secret sins in the light of thy countenance. 9 For when thou art angry all our days are gone:\nwe bring our years to an end, as it were a tale that is told. 10 The days of our age are threescore years and ten; and though men be so strong that they come to fourscore years,\nyet is their strength then but labor and sorrow; so soon passeth it away, and we are gone. 11 But who regardeth the power of thy wrath?\nor feareth aright thy indignation? 12 So teach us to number our days,\nthat we may apply our hearts unto wisdom. 13 Turn thee again, O LORD, at the last,\nand be gracious unto thy servants. 14 O satisfy us with thy mercy, and that soon:\nso shall we rejoice and be glad all the days of our life. 15 Comfort us again now after the time that thou hast plagued us;\nand for the years wherein we have suffered adversity. 16 Show thy servants thy work,\nand their children thy glory. 17 And the glorious majesty of the LORD our God be upon us:\nprosper thou the work of our hands upon us; O prosper thou our handy-work. 18 Glory be to the Father, and tó the Són,\nand to the Hóly Ghóst; 19 As it was in the beginning, † is now, and éver sháll be,\nworld wíthout énd. Amen.",
