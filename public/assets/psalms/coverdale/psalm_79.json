  "text": "O GOD, the heathen are come into thine inheritance;\nthy holy temple have they defiled, and made Jerusalem an heap of stones. 2 The dead bodies of thy servants have they given to be meat unto the fowls of the air,\nand the flesh of thy saints unto the beasts of the land. 3 Their blood have they shed like water on every side of Jerusalem,\nand there was no man to bury them. 4 We are become an open shame to our enemies,\na very scorn and derision unto them that are round about us. 5 LORD, how long wilt thou be angry?\nshall thy jealousy burn like fire forever? 6 Pour out thine indignation upon the heathen that have not known thee;\nand upon the kingdoms that have not called upon thy Name. 7 For they have devoured Jacob,\nand laid waste his dwelling place. 8 O remember not our old sins, but have mercy upon us, and that soon;\nfor we are come to great misery. 9 Help us, O God of our salvation, for the glory of thy Name:\nO deliver us, and be merciful unto our sins, for thy Name’s sake. 10 Wherefore do the heathen say,\nWhere is now their God? 11 O let the vengeance of thy servants’ blood that is shed,\nbe openly showed upon the heathen, in our sight. 12 O let the sorrowful sighing of the prisoners come before thee;\naccording to the greatness of thy power, preserve thou those that are appointed to die. 13 And for the blasphemy wherewith our neighbors have blasphemed thee,\nreward thou them, O Lord, sevenfold into their bosom. 14 So we, that are thy people, and sheep of thy pasture, shall give thee thanks forever,\nand will alway be showing forth thy praise from generation to generation. 15 Glory be to the Father, and tó the Són,\nand to the Hóly Ghóst; 16 As it was in the beginning, † is now, and éver sháll be,\nworld wíthout énd. Amen.",
