  "text": "HOLD not thy tongue, O God, keep not still silence:\nrefrain not thyself, O God. 2 For lo, thine enemies make a murmuring;\nand they that hate thee have lift up their head. 3 They have imagined craftily against thy people,\nand taken counsel against thy secret ones. 4 They have said, Come, and let us root them out, that they be no more a people,\nand that the name of Israel may be no more in remembrance. 5 For they have cast their heads together with one consent,\nand are confederate against thee: 6 The tabernacles of the Edomites, and the Ishmaelites;\nthe Moabites, and Hagarenes; 7 Gebal, and Ammon, and Amalek;\nthe Philistines, with them that dwell at Tyre. 8 Assyria also is joined with them;\nthey have holpen the children of Lot. 9 But do thou to them as unto the Midianites;\nunto Sisera, and unto Jabin at the brook of Kishon; 10 Who perished at Endor,\nand became as the dung of the earth. 11 Make them and their princes like Oreb and Zeeb;\nyea, make all their princes like as Zebah and Zalmunna; 12 Who say, Let us take to ourselves\nthe houses of God in possession. 13 O my God, make them like unto the whirling dust,\nand as the stubble before the wind; 14 Like as the fire that burneth up the forest,\nand as the flame that consumeth the mountains; 15 Pursue them even so with thy tempest,\nand make them afraid with thy storm. 16 Make their faces ashamed, O LORD,\nthat they may seek thy Name. 17 Let them be confounded and vexed ever more and more;\nlet them be put to shame, and perish. 18 And they shall know that thou, whose Name is JEHOVAH,\nart only the Most Highest over all the earth. 19 Glory be to the Father, and tó the Són,\nand to the Hóly Ghóst; 20 As it was in the beginning, † is now, and éver sháll be,\nworld wíthout énd. Amen.",
