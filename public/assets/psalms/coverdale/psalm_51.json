  "text": "HAVE mercy upon me, O God, after thy great goodness;\naccording to the multitude of thy mercies do away mine offences. 2 Wash me throughly from my wickedness,\nand cleanse me from my sin. 3 For I acknowledge my faults,\nand my sin is ever before me. 4 Against thee only have I sinned, and done this evil in thy sight;\nthat thou mightest be justified in thy saying, and clear when thou shalt judge. 5 Behold, I was shapen in wickedness,\nand in sin hath my mother conceived me. 6 But lo, thou requirest truth in the inward parts,\nand shalt make me to understand wisdom secretly. 7 Thou shalt purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean;\nthou shalt wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow. 8 Thou shalt make me hear of joy and gladness,\nthat the bones which thou hast broken may rejoice. 9 Turn thy face from my sins,\nand put out all my misdeeds. 10 Make me a clean heart, O God,\nand renew a right spirit within me. 11 Cast me not away from thy presence,\nand take not thy holy Spirit from me. 12 O give me the comfort of thy help again,\nand stablish me with thy free Spirit. 13 Then shall I teach thy ways unto the wicked,\nand sinners shall be converted unto thee. 14 Deliver me from blood-guiltiness, O God, thou that art the God of my health;\nand my tongue shall sing of thy righteousness. 15 Thou shalt open my lips, O Lord,\nand my mouth shall show thy praise. 16 For thou desirest no sacrifice, else would I give it thee;\nbut thou delightest not in burnt-offerings. 17 The sacrifice of God is a troubled spirit:\na broken and contrite heart, O God, shalt thou not despise. 18 O be favorable and gracious unto Sion;\nbuild thou the walls of Jerusalem. 19 Then shalt thou be pleased with the sacrifice of righteousness, with the burnt-offerings and oblations;\nthen shall they offer young bullocks upon thine altar. 20 Glory be to the Father, and tó the Són,\nand to the Hóly Ghóst; 21 As it was in the beginning, † is now, and éver sháll be,\nworld wíthout énd. Amen.",
