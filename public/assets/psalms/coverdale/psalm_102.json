  "text": "HEAR my prayer, O LORD,\nand let my crying come unto thee. 2 Hide not thy face from me in the time of my trouble;\nincline thine ear unto me when I call; O hear me, and that right soon. 3 For my days are consumed away like smoke,\nand my bones are burnt up as it were a firebrand. 4 My heart is smitten down, and withered like grass;\nso that I forget to eat my bread. 5 For the voice of my groaning,\nmy bones will scarce cleave to my flesh. 6 I am become like a pelican in the wilderness,\nand like an owl that is in the desert. 7 I have watched, and am even as it were a sparrow,\nthat sitteth alone upon the housetop. 8 Mine enemies revile me all the day long;\nand they that are mad upon me are sworn together against me. 9 For I have eaten ashes as it were bread,\nand mingled my drink with weeping; 10 And that, because of thine indignation and wrath;\nfor thou hast taken me up, and cast me down. 11 My days are gone like a shadow,\nand I am withered like grass. 12 But thou, O LORD, shalt endure forever,\nand thy remembrance throughout all generations. 13 Thou shalt arise, and have mercy upon Sion;\nfor it is time that thou have mercy upon her, yea, the time is come. 14 And why? thy servants think upon her stones,\nand it pitieth them to see her in the dust. 15 The nations shall fear thy Name, O LORD;\nand all the kings of the earth thy majesty; 16 When the LORD shall build up Sion,\nand when his glory shall appear; 17 When he turneth him unto the prayer of the poor destitute,\nand despiseth not their desire. 18 This shall be written for those that come after,\nand the people which shall be born shall praise the LORD. 19 For he hath looked down from his sanctuary;\nout of the heaven did the LORD behold the earth; 20 That he might hear the mournings of such as are in captivity,\nand deliver them that are appointed unto death; 21 That they may declare the Name of the LORD in Sion,\nand his worship at Jerusalem; 22 When the peoples are gathered together,\nand the kingdoms also, to serve the LORD. 23 He brought down my strength in my journey,\nand shortened my days. 24 But I said, O my God, take me not away in the midst of mine age;\nas for thy years, they endure throughout all generations. 25 Thou, Lord, in the beginning hast laid the foundation of the earth,\nand the heavens are the work of thy hands. 26 They shall perish, but thou shalt endure:\nthey all shall wax old as doth a garment; 27 And as a vesture shalt thou change them, and they shall be changed;\nbut thou art the same, and thy years shall not fail. 28 The children of thy servants shall continue,\nand their seed shall stand fast in thy sight. 29 Glory be to the Father, and tó the Són,\nand to the Hóly Ghóst; 30 As it was in the beginning, † is now, and éver sháll be,\nworld wíthout énd.
