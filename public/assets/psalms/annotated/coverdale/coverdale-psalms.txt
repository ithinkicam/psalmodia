Psalm 1. Beatus vir qui non abiit.
BLESSED is the man that hath not walked in the counsel of the ungodly † nor stood in the wáy of sínners,
* and hath not sat in the séat of the scórnful.
2 But his delight is in the láw of the LÓRD; * and in his law will he exercise himself dáy and níght.
3 And he shall be like a tree plánted by the wáterside, * that will bring forth his frúit in due séason.
4 His leaf also sháll not wíther; * and look, whatsoever he dóeth, it shall prósper.
5 As for the ungodly, it is nót so with thém; * but they are like the chaff, which the wind scattereth away
from the fáce of the éarth.
6 Therefore the ungodly shall not be able to stánd in the júdgment, * neither the sinners in the congregátion
of the ríghteous.
7 But the LORD knoweth the wáy of the ríghteous; * and the way of the ungódly shall pérish.
8 Glory be to the Father, and tó the Són, * and to the Hóly Ghóst;
9 As it was in the beginning, † is now, and éver sháll be, * world wíthout énd.
 Amen.
Psalm 2. Quare fremuerunt gentes?
WHY do the heathen so fúriously rage togéther? * and why do the people imágine a váin thing?
2 The kings of the earth stand up, and the rulers take cóunsel togéther * against the LORD, and agàinst his
Anóinted:
3 Let us break their bónds asúnder, * and cast away their córds from ús.
4 He that dwelleth in heaven shall láugh them to scórn: * the LORD shall háve them in derísion.
5 Then shall he speak unto thém in his wráth, * and vex them in his sóre displéasure:
6 Yet have I set my King upon my hóly hill of Síon.* I will rehéarse the décree;
7 The LORD hath sáid unto mé,* Thou art my Son, this dáy have I begótten thee.
8 Desire of me, and I shall give thee the nátions for thine inhéritance, * and the utmost parts of the éarth for
thy posséssion.
9 Thou shalt bruise them with a ród of íron, * and break them in pieces like a pótter’s véssel.
10 Be wise now therefore, Ó ye kíngs; * be instructed, ye that are júdges of the éarth.
11 Serve the LÓRD in féar, * and rejoice unto hím with réverence.
12 Kiss the Son, lést he be ángry,* and so ye pérish from the right wáy
13 If his wrath be kindled, yéa but a líttle. * Blessed are all they that put their trúst in hím.
14 Glory be to the Father, and tó the Són, * and to the Hóly Ghóst;
15 As it was in the beginning, † is now, and éver sháll be, * world wíthout énd.
 Amen.
Psalm 3. Domine, quid multiplicati?
LORD, how are they incréased that tróuble me! * many are they that ríse agáinst me.
2 Many one there be that sáy of my sóul, * There is no help for hím in his Gód.
3 But thou, O LÓRD, art my defénder; * thou art my worship, and the lifter úp of my héad.
4 I did call upon the LÓRD with my vóice, * and he heard me out of his hóly híll.
5 I laid me down and slept, and róse up agàin; * for the LÓRD sustáined me.
6 I will not be afraid for ten thóusands of the péople, * that have set themselves against me róund abóut.
7 Up, LORD, and help me, O my God, † for thou smitest all mine énemies upon the chéekbone; * thou hast
broken the téeth of the ungódly.
8 Salvation belóngeth unto the LÓRD; * and thy blessing is upón thy péople.
9 Glory be to the Father, and tó the Són, * and to the Hóly Ghóst;
10 As it was in the beginning, † is now, and éver sháll be, * world wíthout énd.
 Amen.
Psalm 4. Cum invocarem.
HEAR me when I call, O God of my righteousness: † thou hast set me at liberty when Ī was in tróuble;
have mercy upon me, and hárken unto my práyer.
2 O ye sons of men, how long will ye bláspheme mine hónor, * and have such pleasure in vanity, and séek
after fálsehood?
3 Know this also, that the LORD hath chosen to himself the mán that is gódly; * when I call upon the LÓRD
he will héar me.
4 Stand in áwe, and sin nót; * commune with your own heart, and in your chámber, and be stíll.
5 Offer the sácrifice of ríghteousness, * and put your trúst in the LÓRD.
6 There be mány that sáy, * Who will shów us any góod?
7 LORD, líft thou úp * the light of thy cóuntenance upón us.
8 Thou hast put gládness in my héart; * yea, more than when their corn and wine and óil incréase. 
9 I will lay me down in peace, and táke my rést; * for it is thou, LORD, only, that makest me dwéll in sáfety.
10 Glory be to the Father, and tó the Són, * and to the Hóly Ghóst;
11 As it was in the beginning, † is now, and éver sháll be, * world wíthout énd.
 Amen.
Psalm 5. Verba mea auribus.
PONDER my wórds, O LÓRD, * consider my méditátion.
2 O harken thou unto the voice of my calling, my Kíng and my Gód: * for unto thee will I máke my práyer.
3 My voice shalt thou hear betimes, O LORD; † early in the morning will I direct my práyer unto thée, • and
wíll look úp
4 For thou art the God that hast no pléasure in wíckedness; * neither shall any evil dwéll with thée.
5 Such as be foolish shall not stánd in thy síght; * for thou hatest all them that wórk iníquity.
6 Thou shalt destroy thém that spéak lies: * the LORD will abhor both the bloodthirsty and decéitful mán.
7 But as for me, in the multitude of thy mercy I will come ínto thine hóuse; * and in thy fear will I worship
toward thy hóly témple.
8 Lead me, O LORD, in thy righteousness, becáuse of mine énemies; * make thy way pláin before my fáce.
9 For there is no fáithfulness in their móuth; * their inward párts are very wíckedness.
10 Their throat is an ópen sépulchre; * they flátter with their tóngue.
11 Destroy thou them, O God; † let them perish through their ówn imaginátions; * cast them out in the
multitude of their ungodliness; for they have rebélled agáinst thee.
12 And let all them that put their trúst in thee rejóice: * they shall ever be giving of thanks, because thou
defendest them; they that love thy Name shall be jóyful in thée;
13 For thou, LORD, wilt give thy bléssing unto the ríghteous, * and with thy favorable kindness wilt thou
defend him as wíth a shíeld.
14 Glory be to the Father, and tó the Són, * and to the Hóly Ghóst;
15 As it was in the beginning, † is now, and éver sháll be, * world wíthout énd.
 Amen.
Evening Prayer.
Psalm 6. Domine, ne in furore.
LORD, rebuke me not in thíne indignàtion, * neither chasten me in thý displéasure.
2 Have mercy upon me, O LORD, for Í am wéak; * O LORD, heal me, for my bónes are véxed.
3 My soul also ís sore tróubled: * but, LORD, how lóng wilt thou púnish me?
4 Turn thee, O LORD, and delíver my sóul; * O save me, for thy mércy’s sáke.
5 For in death no man remémbereth thée; * and who will give thee thánks in the pít?
6 I am wéary of my gróaning; * every night wash I my bed, and water my cóuch with my téars.
7 My beauty is gone for véry tróuble, * and worn away because of áll mine énemies.
8 Away from me, all ye that wórk iníquity; * for the LORD hath heard the vóice of my wéeping.
9 The LORD hath héard my petítion; * the LORD will recéive my práyer.
10 All mine enemies shall be confóunded, and sore véxed; * they shall be turned back, and pút to shame
súddenly.
11 Glory be to the Father, and tó the Són, * and to the Hóly Ghóst;
12 As it was in the beginning, † is now, and éver sháll be, * world wíthout énd.
 Amen.
Psalm 7. Domine, Deus meus.
O LORD my God, in thee have I pút my trúst: * save me from all them that pérsecute me, and déliver me;
2 Lest he devour my soul like a lion, and téar it in píeces, * while there is nóne to hélp.
3 O LORD my God, if I have done ány such thíng; * or if there be any wíckedness in my hánds;
4 If I have rewarded evil unto him that dealt fríendly with mé; * (yea, I have delivered him that without any
cáuse is mine énemy;)
5 Then let mine enemy persecute my sóul, and táke me; * yea, let him tread my life down upon the earth,
and lay mine hónor in the dúst.
6 Stand up, O LORD, in thy wrath, and lift up thyself, because of the indignátion of mine énemies; * arise
up for me in the judgment that hast thou commànded.
7 And so shall the congregation of the péoples come abóut thee: * for their sakes therefore lift up thysélf
agáin.
8 The LORD shall judge the peoples: give séntence with me, O LÓRD, * according to my righteousness, and
according to the ínnocency that is ín me. 
9 O let the wickedness of the ungodly cóme to an énd; * but guide thóu the júst.
10 For the ríghteous Gód * trieth the very héarts and réins.
11 My help cómeth of Gód, * who preserveth them that are trúe of héart.
12 God is a righteous Judge, stróng, and pátient; * and God is provóked every dáy.
13 If a man will not turn, he will whét his swórd; * he hath bent his bow, and máde it réady.
14 He hath prepared for him the ínstruments of déath; * he ordaineth his árrows against the pérsecutors.
15 Behold, the ungodly traváileth with iníquity; * he hath conceived mischief, and bróught forth fálsehood.
16 He hath graven and dígged up a pít, * and is fallen himself into the destruction that he máde for óther.
17 For his travail shall come upón his own héad, * and his wickedness shall fáll on his own páte.
18 I will give thanks unto the LORD, accórding to his ríghteousness; * and I will praise the Name of the
LÓRD Most Hígh.
19 Glory be to the Father, and tó the Són, * and to the Hóly Ghóst;
20 As it was in the beginning, † is now, and éver sháll be, * world wíthout énd.
 Amen.
Psalm 8. Domine, Dominus noster.
O LORD our Governor, how excellent is thy Name in áll the wórld; * thou that hast set thy glóry above the
héavens!
2 Out of the mouth of very babes and sucklings hast thou ordained strength, becáuse of thine énemies, *
that thou mightest still the énemy and the avénger.
3 When I consider thy heavens, even the wórk of thy fíngers; * the moon and the stars which thóu hast
ordáined;
4 What is man, that thou art míndful of hím? * and the son of man, that thou vísitest hím?
5 Thou madest him lówer than the ángels, * to crown him with glóry and wórship.
6 Thou makest him to have dominion of the wórks of thy hánds; * and thou hast put all things in subjéction
under his féet:
7 All shéep and óxen; * yea, and the béasts of the fíeld;
8 The fowls of the air, and the físhes of the séa; * and whatsoever walketh through the páths of the séas.
9 O LÓRD our Góvernor, * how excellent is thy Name in áll the wórld!
10 Glory be to the Father, and tó the Són, * and to the Hóly Ghóst;
11 As it was in the beginning, † is now, and éver sháll be, * world wíthout énd.
 Amen.
THE SECOND DAY
Morning Prayer
Psalm 9. Confitebor tibi.
I WILL give thanks unto thee, O LORD, with mý whole héart; * I will speak of all thy márvelous wórks.
2 I will be glad and rejóice in thée; * yea, my songs will I make of thy Náme, O thou Most Híghest.
3 While mine enemies are dríven báck, * they shall fall and pérish at thy présence.
4 For thou hast maintained my ríght and my cáuse; * thou art set in the thróne that judgest ríght.
5 Thou hast rebuked the heathen, and destróyed the ungódly; * thou hast put out their name for éver and
éver.
6 O thou enemy, thy destructions are come to a perpétual énd; * even as the cities which thou hast
destroyed, whose memorial is pérished with thém.
7 But the LORD shall endúre foréver; * he hath also prepared his séat for júdgment.
8 For he shall judge the wórld in ríghteousness, * and minister true júdgment unto the péople.
9 The LORD also will be a defénse for the oppréssed, * even a refuge in due tíme of tróuble.
10 And they that know thy Name will put their trúst in thée; * for thou, LORD, hast never fáiled them that
séek thee.
11 O praise the LORD which dwélleth in Síon; * show the péople of his dóings.
12 For when he maketh inquisition for blood, he remémbereth thém, * and forgetteth not the compláint of
the póor.
13 Have mercy upon me, O LORD;† consider the trouble which I suffer of thém that háte me, * thou that
liftest me up from the gátes of déath;
14 That I may show all thy praises within the gates of the dáughter of Síon: * I will rejóice in thy salvátion.
15 The heathen are sunk down in the pít that they máde; * in the same net which they hid privily is théir
foot táken.
16 The LORD is known to éxecute júdgment; * the ungodly is trapped in the wórk of his own hánds.
17 The wicked shall be túrned to destrúction, * and all the péople that forget Gód.
18 For the poor shall not álway be forgótten; * the patient abiding of the meek shall not pérish foréver. 
19 Up, LORD, and let not man háve the upper hánd; * let the heathen be júdged in thy síght.
20 Put them in féar, O LÓRD, * that the heathen may know themselves to bé but mén.
21 Glory be to the Father, and tó the Són, * and to the Hóly Ghóst;
22 As it was in the beginning, † is now, and éver sháll be, * world wíthout énd.
 Amen.
Psalm 10. Ut quid, Domine?
WHY standest thou so far óff, O LÓRD, * and hidest thy face in the needful tíme of tróuble?
2 The ungodly, for his own lust, doth pérsecute the póor: * let them be taken in the crafty wiliness that théy
have imágined.
3 For the ungodly hath made boast of his ówn heart’s desíre, * and speaketh good of the covetous, whom
the LÓRD abhórreth.
4 The ungodly is so proud, that he cáreth not for Gód, * neither is God in áll his thóughts.
5 His ways are álway gríevous; * thy judgments are far above out of his sight, and therefore defíeth he all
his énemies.
6 For he hath said in his heart, Tush, I shall néver be cast dówn, * there shall no harm háppen unto mé.
7 His mouth is full of cursing, decéit, and fráud; * under his tongue is ungódliness and vánity.
8 He sitteth lurking in the thievish córners of the stréets, * and privily in his lurking dens doth he murder the
innocent; his eyes are sét against the póor.
9 For he lieth waiting secretly; even as a lion lúrketh he in his dén, * that he may rávish the póor.
10 He doth rávish the póor, * when he gétteth him into his nét.
11 He falleth down, and húmbleth himsélf, * that the congregation of the poor may fall into the hánds of his
cáptains.
12 He hath said in his heart, Tush, Gód hath forgótten; * he hideth away his face, and he will néver sée it.
13 Arise, O LORD God, and líft up thine hánd; * forgét not the póor.
14 Wherefore should the wicked bláspheme Gód, * while he doth say in his heart, Tush, thou God cárest
not fór it?
15 Surely thóu hast séen it; * for thou beholdest ungodliness and wrong, that thou mayest take the mátter
into thy hánd.
16 The poor committeth himsélf unto thée; * for thou art the hélper of the fríendless.
17 Break thou the power of the ungódly and malícious; * search out his ungodliness, untíl thou find nóne.
18 The LORD is King for éver and éver, * and the heathen are pérished out of the lánd.
19 LORD, thou hast heard the desíre of the póor; * thou preparest their heart, and thíne ear hárkeneth;
20 To help the fatherless and póor unto their ríght, * that the man of the earth be no more exálted agáinst
them.
21 Glory be to the Father, and tó the Són, * and to the Hóly Ghóst;
22 As it was in the beginning, † is now, and éver sháll be, * world wíthout énd.
 Amen.
Psalm 11. In Domino confido.
IN the LORD put I my trúst; † how say ye thén to my sóul, that she should flee as a bírd unto the híll?
2 For lo, the ungodly bend their bow, and make ready their árrows within the qúiver, * that they may
privily shoot at them which are trúe of héart.
3 If the foundátions be destróyed, * what can the ríghteous dó?
4 The LORD is in his hóly témple; * the LORD’s séat is in héaven.
5 His eyes consíder the póor, * and his eyelids try the chíldren of mén.
6 The LORD appróveth the ríghteous: * but the ungodly, and him that delighteth in wickedness, dóth his
soul ábhor.
7 Upon the ungodly he shall rain snares, fire and brimstone, stórm and témpest: * this shall be their pórtion
to drínk.
8 For the righteous LORD lóveth ríghteousness; * his countenance will behold the thíng that is júst.
9 Glory be to the Father, and tó the Són, * and to the Hóly Ghóst;
10 As it was in the beginning, † is now, and éver sháll be, * world wíthout énd.
 Amen.
Evening Prayer
Psalm 12. Salvum me fac.
HELP me, LORD, for there is not one gódly man léft; * for the faithful are minished from among the
chíldren of mén. 
2 They talk of vanity every óne with his néighbor; * they do but flatter with their lips, and dissemble in
théir double héart.
3 The LORD shall root out all decéitful líps, * and the tongue that spéaketh proud thíngs;
4 Which have said, With our tóngue will we preváil; * we are they that ought to speak; who is lórd over ús?
5 Now, for the comfortless troubles’ sáke of the néedy, * and because of the deep síghing of the póor,
6 I will up, sáith the LÓRD; * and will help every one from him that swelleth against him, and will sét him
at rést.
7 The words of the LÓRD are pure wórds; * even as the silver which from the earth is tried, and purified
seven tímes in the fíre.
8 Thou shalt keep thém, O LÓRD; * thou shalt preserve them from this generátion foréver.
9 The ungodly walk on évery síde: * when they are exalted, the children of men are pút to rebúke.
10 Glory be to the Father, and tó the Són, * and to the Hóly Ghóst;
11 As it was in the beginning, † is now, and éver sháll be, * world wíthout énd.
 Amen.
Psalm 13. Usquequo, Domine?
HOW long wilt thou forget me, O LÓRD; foréver? * how long wilt thou hide thy fáce from mé?
2 How long shall I seek counsel in my soul, and be so véxed in my héart? * how long shall mine enemy
tríumph over mé?
3 Consider, and hear me, O LÓRD my Gód; * lighten mine eyes, that I sléep not in déath;
4 Lest mine enemy say, I have preváiled against hím: * for if I be cast down, they that trouble me will
rejóice at ít.
5 But my trust is ín thy mércy, * and my heart is jóyful in thy salvátion.
6 I will sing of the LORD, because he hath dealt so lóvingly with mé; * yea, I will praise the Name of the
Lórd Most Híghest.
7 Glory be to the Father, and tó the Són, * and to the Hóly Ghóst;
8 As it was in the beginning, † is now, and éver sháll be, * world wíthout énd.
 Amen.
Psalm 14. Dixit insipiens.
THE fool hath sáid in his héart, * There ís no Gód.
2 They are corrupt, and become abóminable in their dóings; * there is none that doeth good, nó not óne.
3 The LORD looked down from heaven upon the chíldren of mén, * to see if there were any that would
understand, and séek after Gód.
4 But they are all gone out of the way, they are altogether becóme abóminable; * there is none that doeth
good, nó not óne.
5 Have they no knowledge, that they are all such wórkers of míschief, * eating up my people as it were
bread, and call not upón the LÓRD ?
6 There were they brought in great fear, even where nó fear wás; * for God is in the generátion of the
ríghteous.
7 As for you, ye have made a mock at the cóunsel of the póor; * because he putteth his trúst in the LÓRD.
8 Who shall give salvation unto Ísrael out of Síon? * When the LORD turneth the captivity of his people,
then shall Jacob rejoice, and Ísrael shall be glád.
8 Glory be to the Father, and tó the Són, * and to the Hóly Ghóst;
9 As it was in the beginning, † is now, and éver sháll be, * world without wíthout énd.
 Amen.
THE THIRD DAY
Morning Prayer
Psalm 15. Domine, quis habitabit?
LORD, who shall dwéll in thy tábernacle? * or who shall rest upon thy hóly híll?
2 Even he that leadeth an úncorrupt lífe, * and doeth the thing which is right, and speaketh the trúth from
his héart.
3 He that hath used no deceit in his tongue, nor done évil to his néighbor, * and hath not slándered his
néighbor.
4 He that setteth not by himself, but is lówly in his own éyes, * and maketh much of them that féar the
LÓRD.
5 He that sweareth unto his neighbor, and disappóinteth him nót, * though it were tó his own híndrance.
6 He that hath not given his móney upon úsury, * nor taken rewárd against the ínnocent.
7 Whoso dóeth these thíngs * shall néver fáll. 
8 Glory be to the Father, and tó the Són, * and to the Hóly Ghóst;
9 As it was in the beginning, † is now, and éver sháll be, * world wíthout énd.
 Amen.
Psalm 16. Conserva me, Domine.
PRESERVE mé, O Gód; * for in thee have I pút my trúst.
2 O my soul, thou hast sáid unto the LÓRD, * Thou art my God; I have no good líke unto thée.
3 All my delight is upon the sáints that are in the éarth, * and upon such as excél in vírtue.
4 But they that run after anóther gód * shall háve great tróuble.
5 Their drink-offerings of blóod will I not óffer, * neither make mention of their námes within my líps.
6 The LORD himself is the portion of mine inhéritance, and of my cúp; * thou shalt maintáin my lót.
7 The lot is fallen unto mé in a fair gróund; * yea, I have a góodly héritage.
8 I will thank the LORD for gíving me wárning; * my reins also chasten me ín the night séason.
9 I have set the LORD álway befóre me; * for he is on my right hand, therefore I sháll not fáll.
10 Wherefore my heart is glad, and my glóry rejóiceth: * my flesh also shall rést in hópe.
11 For why? thou shalt not leave my sóul in héll; * neither shalt thou suffer thy Holy One to sée corrúption.
12 Thou shalt show me the path of life: in thy presence is the fúllness of jóy, * and at thy right hand there is
pléasure forévermore.
13 Glory be to the Father, and tó the Són, * and to the Hóly Ghóst;
14 As it was in the beginning, † is now, and éver sháll be, * world wíthout énd.
 Amen.
Psalm 17. Exaudi, Domine.
HEAR the right, O LORD, consíder my compláint, * and harken unto my prayer, that goeth not óut of
feigned líps.
2 Let my sentence come fórth from thy présence; * and let thine eyes look upon the thíng that is équal.
3 Thou hast proved and visited mine heart in the night season; † thou hast tried me, and shalt find no
wíckedness in mé; * for I am utterly purposed that my móuth shall not offénd.
4 As for the wórks of mén, * by the word of thy lips I have kept me from the wáys of the destróyer.
5 O hold thou up my góings in thy páths, * that my fóotsteps slip nót.
6 I have called upon thee, O God, for thóu shalt héar me: * incline thine ear to me, and hárken unto my
wórds.
7 Show thy marvelous loving-kindness, † thou that art the Savior of them which put their trúst in thée, *
from such as resíst thy right hánd.
8 Keep me as the ápple of an éye; * hide me under the shádow of thy wíngs,
9 From the ungodly, that tróuble mé; * mine enemies compass me round about, to take awáy my sóul.
10 They are inclosed in théir own fát, * and their mouth spéaketh proud thíngs.
11 They lie waiting in our way on évery síde, * watching to cast us dówn to the gróund;
12 Like as a lion that is gréedy of his préy, * and as it were a lion’s whelp lurking in sécret pláces.
13 Up, LORD, disappoint him, and cást him dówn; * deliver my soul from the ungodly, by thíne own swórd;
14 Yea, by thy hand, O LORD; from the men of the évil wórld; * which have their portion in this life, whose
bellies thou fillest with thÿ hid tréasure.
15 They have children at théir desíre, * and leave the rest of their súbstance for their bábes.
16 But as for me, I shall behold thy présence in ríghteousness; * and when I awake up after thy likeness, I
sháll be sátisfied.
17 Glory be to the Father, and tó the Són, * and to the Hóly Ghóst;
18 As it was in the beginning, † is now, and éver sháll be, * world wíthout énd.
 Amen.
Evening Prayer
Psalm 18.
I. Diligam te, Domine.
I WILL love thee, O LÓRD, my stréngth. * The LORD is my stony rock, and mÿ defénse;
2 My Savior, my God, and my might, in whóm I will trúst; * my buckler, the horn also of my salvátion, and
my refúge.
3 I will call upon the LORD, which is wórthy to be práised; * so shall I be sáfe from mine énemies.
4 The sorrows of death cómpassed mé, * and the overflowings of ungodliness máde me afráid.
5 The pains of hell cáme about mé; * the snares of déath overtóok me. 
6 In my trouble I cálled upon the LÓRD, * and compláined unto my Gód:
7 So he heard my voice out of his hóly témple, * and my complaint came before him; it entered even ínto
his éars.
8 The earth trémbled and quáked, * the very foundations also of the hills shook, and were removed,
becáuse he was wróth.
9 There went a smoke óut in his présence, * and a consuming fire out of his mouth, so that coals were
kíndled at ít.
10 He bowed the heavens álso, and came dówn, * and it was dark únder his féet.
11 He rode upon the Chérubim, and did flÿ; * he came flying upon the wíngs of the wínd.
12 He made darkness his sécret pláce, * his pavilion round about him with dark water, and thick clóuds to
cóver him.
13 At the brightness of his presence his clóuds remóved; * hailstones and cóals of fíre.
14 The LORD also thundered out of heaven, and the Highest gáve his thúnder; * hailstones and cóals of fíre.
15 He sent out his arrows, and scáttered thém; * he cast forth líghtnings, and destróyed them.
16 The springs of waters were seen, and the foundations of the round wórld were discóvered, * at thy
chiding, O LORD, at the blasting of the bréath of thy displéasure.
17 He sent down from on hígh to fétch me, * and took me óut of many wáters.
18 He delivered me from my strongest enemy, and from thém which háte me; * for they were too míghty
for mé.
19 They came upon me in the dáy of my tróuble; * but the LÓRD was my uphólder.
20 He brought me forth also into a pláce of líberty; * he brought me forth, even because he had a fávor unto
mé.
Glory be to the Father, and tó the Són, * and to the Hóly Ghóst;
As it was in the beginning, † is now, and éver sháll be, * world wíthout énd.
 Amen.
II. Et retribuet mihi
THE LORD rewarded me after my ríghteous déaling, * according to the cleanness of my hands did he
recómpense mé.
22 Because I have kept the wáys of the LÓRD, * and have not forsaken my God, as the wícked dóth.
23 For I have an eye unto áll his láws, * and will not cast out his commándments from mé.
24 I was also uncorrúpt befóre him, * and eschewed míne own wíckedness.
25 Therefore the LORD rewarded me after my ríghteous déaling, * and according unto the cleanness of my
hánds in his éyesight.
26 With the holy thou shált be hóly, * and with a perfect man thou shált be pérfect.
27 With the clean thou shált be cléan, * and with the froward thou shált be fróward.
28 For thou shalt save the péople that are in advérsity, * and shalt bring down the high lóoks of the próud.
29 Thou also shalt líght my cándle; * the LORD my God shall make my dárkness to be líght.
30 For in thee I shall discomfit an hóst of mén, * and with the help of my God I shall leap óver the wáll.
31 The way of God is an úndefiled wáy: * the word of the LORD also is tried in the fire; he is the defender of
all them that put their trúst in hím.
32 For who is Gód, but the LÓRD? * or who hath any strength, excépt our Gód?
33 It is God that girdeth me with stréngth of wár, * and maketh mÿ way pérfect.
34 He maketh my féet like harts’ féet, * and setteth me úp on hígh.
35 He teacheth mine hánds to fíght, * and mine arms shall bend even a bów of stéel.
36 Thou hast given me the defense of thÿ salvátion; * thy right hand also shall hold me up, and thy loving
correction shall máke me gréat.
37 Thou shalt make room enough under mé for to gó, * that my footsteps sháll not slíde.
38 I will follow upon mine enemies, and óvertake thém; * neither will I turn again till I have déstroyed
thém.
39 I will smite them, that they shall not be áble to stánd, * but fall únder my féet.
40 Thou hast girded me with stréngth unto the báttle; * thou shalt throw down mine énemies únder me.
41 Thou hast made mine enemies also to turn their bácks upon mé, * and I shall destróy them that háte me.
42 They shall cry, but there shall be nóne to help thém; * yea, even unto the LORD shall they cry, but he
sháll not héar them.
43 I will beat them as small as the dust befóre the wínd: * I will cast them out as the cláy in the stréets.
44 Thou shalt deliver me from the strívings of the péople, * and thou shalt make me the head of the nations;
a people whom I have not knówn shall sérve me.
45 As soon as they hear of me, they sháll obéy me; * the strangers shall feign obédience unto mé.
46 The strángers shall fáil, * and come trembling óut of their stróngholds. 
47 The LORD liveth; and blessed be mÿ strong hélper, * and praised be the Gód of my salvátion;
48 Even the God that seeth that Ī be avénged, * and subdueth the péople unto mé.
49 It is he that delivereth me from my cruel enemies, † and setteth me up abóve mine ádversaries: * thou
shalt rid me from the wícked mán.
50 For this cause will I give thanks unto thee, O LORD, amóng the Géntiles, * and sing praises únto thy
Náme.
51 Great prosperity giveth he únto his Kíng, * and showeth loving-kindness unto David his anointed, and
unto his séed forevermóre.
52 Glory be to the Father, and tó the Són, * and to the Hóly Ghóst;
53 As it was in the beginning, † is now, and éver sháll be, * world wíthout énd.
 Amen.
THE FOURTH DAY
Morning Prayer
Psalm 19. Caeli enarrant.
THE heavens declare the glóry of Gód; * and the firmament shóweth his hándy-work.
2 One day télleth anóther; * and one night cértifieth anóther.
3 There is neither spéech nor lánguage; * but their voices are héard amóng them.
4 Their sound is gone óut into áll lands; * and their words into the énds of the wórld.
5 In them hath he set a tábernacle for the sún; * which cometh forth as a bridegroom out of his chamber,
and rejoiceth as a gíant to run his cóurse.
6 It goeth forth from the uttermost part of the heaven, † and runneth about unto the énd of it agáin; * and
there is nothing hid from the héat thereóf.
7 The law of the LORD is an undefiled law, convérting the sóul; * the testimony of the LORD is sure, and
giveth wísdom unto the símple.
8 The statutes of the LORD are right, and rejóice the héart; * the commandment of the LORD is pure, and
giveth líght unto the éyes.
9 The fear of the LORD is clean, and endúreth foréver; * the judgments of the LORD are true, and ríghteous
altogéther.
10 More to be desired are they than gold, yea, than múch fine góld; * sweeter also than hóney, and the
hóneycomb.
11 Moreover, by them is thy sérvant táught; * and in keeping of them there is gréat rewárd.
12 Who can tell how óft he offéndeth? * O cleanse thou me from my sécret fáults.
13 Keep thy servant also from presumptuous sins, † lest they get the domínion over mé; * so shall I be
undefiled, and innocent from the gréat offénce.
14 Let the words of my mouth, and the meditation of my heart, be alway accéptable in thy síght, * O
LORD, my stréngth and my redéemer.
15 Glory be to the Father, and tó the Són, * and to the Hóly Ghóst;
16 As it was in the beginning, † is now, and éver sháll be, * world wíthout énd.
 Amen.
Psalm 20. Exaudiat te Dominus.
THE LORD hear thee in the dáy of tróuble; * the Name of the God of Jácob defénd thee:
2 Send thee hélp from the sánctuary, * and strengthen thee óut of Síon:
3 Remember áll thy ófferings, * and accept thy búrnt sacrífice:
4 Grant thee thy héart’s desíre, * and fulfíll all thy mínd.
5 We will rejoice in thy salvation, † and triumph in the Name of the Lórd our Gód: * the LORD perform áll
thy petítions.
6 Now know I that the LORD helpeth his anointed, † and will hear him from his hóly héaven, * even with
the wholesome stréngth of his right hánd.
7 Some put their trust in chariots, and sóme in hórses; * but we will remember the Name of the LÓRD our
Gód.
8 They are brought dówn and fállen; * but we are risen and stánd upríght.
9 Save, LORD; and hear us, O Kíng of héaven, * when we cáll upon thée.
10 Glory be to the Father, and tó the Són, * and to the Hóly Ghóst;
11 As it was in the beginning, † is now, and éver sháll be, * world wíthout énd.
 Amen.
Psalm 21. Domine, in virtute tua.
THE King shall rejoice in thy stréngth, O LÓRD; * exceeding glad shall he be of thÿ salvátion.
2 Thou hast given him his héart’s desíre, * and hast not denied him the reqúest of his líps. 
3 For thou shalt meet him with the bléssings of góodness, * and shalt set a crown of pure góld upon his héad.
4 He asked life of thee; and thou gávest him a long lífe, * even for éver and éver.
5 His honor is great in thÿ salvátion; * glory and great worship shalt thou láy upon hím.
6 For thou shalt give him everlásting felícity, * and make him glad with the jóy of thy cóuntenance.
7 And why? because the King putteth his trúst in the LÓRD; * and in the mercy of the Most Highest he sháll
not miscárry.
8 All thine enemies shall féel thine hánd; * thy right hand shall find out thém that háte thee.
9 Thou shalt make them like a fiery oven in tíme of thy wráth: * the LORD shall destroy them in his
displeasure, and the fire sháll consúme them.
10 Their fruit shalt thou root óut of the éarth, * and their seed from among the chíldren of mén.
11 For they intended míschief agáinst thee, * and imagined such a device as they are not áble to perfórm.
12 Therefore shalt thou put thém to flíght, * and the strings of thy bow shalt thou make ready against the
fáce of thém.
13 Be thou exalted, LORD, in thíne own stréngth; * so will we sing, and práise thy pówer.
14 Glory be to the Father, and tó the Són, * and to the Hóly Ghóst;
15 As it was in the beginning, † is now, and éver sháll be, * world wíthout énd.

Evening Prayer.
Psalm 22. Deus, Deus meus.
MY God, my God, look upon me; † why hast thou forsáken mé? * and art so far from my health, and from
the wórds of my compláint?
2 O my God, I cry in the daytime, but thou héarest nót; * and in the night season also I táke no rést.
3 And thou contínuest hóly, * O thou Wórship of Īsrael.
4 Our fathers hóped in thée; * they trusted in thee, and thou didst delíver thém.
5 They called upon thée, and were hólpen; * they put their trust in thee, and were nót confóunded.
6 But as for me, I am a wórm, and no mán; * a very scorn of men, and the óutcast of the péople.
7 All they that see me láugh me to scórn; * they shoot out their lips, and sháke their heads, sáying,
8 He trusted in the LORD, that he would delíver hím; * let him deliver him, if hé will háve him.
9 But thou art he that took me óut of my móther’s womb; * thou wast my hope, when I hanged yet upon my
móther’s bréasts.
10 I have been left unto thee ever sínce I was bórn; * thou art my God even from my móther’s wómb.
11 O go not from me; for trouble is hárd at hánd, * and there is nóne to hélp me.
12 Many oxen are cóme about mé; * fat bulls of Bashan close me in on évery síde.
13 They gape upon me wíth their móuths, * as it were a ramping and a róaring líon.
14 I am poured out like water, and all my bones are óut of jóint; * my heart also in the midst of my body is
even like mélting wáx.
15 My strength is dried up like a potsherd, and my tongue cléaveth to my gúms, * and thou bringest me into
the dúst of déath.
16 For many dogs are cóme about mé, * and the council of the wicked layeth síege against mé.
17 They pierced my hands and my feet: † I may tell áll my bónes: * they stand staring and lóoking upon
mé.
18 They part my gárments amóng them, * and cast lots upón my vésture.
19 But be not thou far from mé, O LÓRD; * thou art my succor, haste thée to hélp me.
20 Deliver my sóul from the swórd, * my darling from the pówer of the dóg.
21 Save me from the líon’s móuth; * thou hast heard me also from among the hórns of the únicorns.
22 I will declare thy Náme unto my bréthren; * in the midst of the congregation will Ī praise thée.
23 O praise the LORD, yé that féar him: * magnify him, all ye of the seed of Jacob; and fear him, all ye séed
of Īsrael.
24 For he hath not despised nor abhorred the low estáte of the póor; * he hath not hid his face from him; but
when he called unto hím he héard him.
25 My praise is of thee in the gréat congregátion; * my vows will I perform in the sight of thém that féar
him.
26 The poor shall eat, and be satisfied; † they that seek after the LÓRD shall práise him: * your heart shall
líve foréver.
27 All the ends of the world shall remember themselves, and be túrned unto the LÓRD; * and all the
kindreds of the nations shall wórship befóre him.
28 For the kingdom ís the LÓRD’S, * and he is the Governor amóng the nátions.
29 All such as be fát upon éarth * have éaten, and wórshipped.
30 All they that go down into the dust shall knéel befóre him; * and no man hath qúickened his own sóul.
31 My séed shall sérve him: * they shall be counted unto the Lórd for a generátion. 
32 They shall come, and shall decláre his ríghteousness * unto a people that shall be born, whom the Lórd
hath máde.
33 Glory be to the Father, and tó the Són, * and to the Hóly Ghóst;
34 As it was in the beginning, † is now, and éver sháll be, * world wíthout énd.
 Amen.
Psalm 23. Dominus regit me.
THE LORD ís my shépherd; * therefore can Ī lack nóthing.
2 He shall feed mé in a green pásture, * and lead me forth beside the wáters of cómfort.
3 He shall convért my sóul, * and bring me forth in the paths of righteousness for hís Name’s sáke.
4 Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, † I will féar no évil; * for thou art with me;
thy rod and thy staff cómfort mé.
5 Thou shalt prepare a table before me in the presence of them that tróuble mé; * thou hast anointed my
head with oil, and my cúp shall be fúll.
6 Surely thy loving-kindness and mercy shall follow me all the dáys of my lífe; * and I will dwell in the
house of the LÓRD foréver.
7 Glory be to the Father, and tó the Són, * and to the Hóly Ghóst;
8 As it was in the beginning, † is now, and éver sháll be, * world wíthout énd.

THE FIFTH DAY
Morning Prayer
Psalm 24. Domini est terra.
THE earth is the LORD’s, and all that thérein ís; * the compass of the world, and théy that dwell thérein.
2 For he hath founded it upón the séas, * and stablished it upón the flóods.
3 Who shall ascend into the híll of the LÓRD? * or who shall rise up in his hóly pláce?
4 Even he that hath clean hánds, and a pure héart; * and that hath not lift up his mind unto vanity, nor
sworn to decéive his néighbor.
5 He shall receive the bléssing from the LÓRD, * and righteousness from the Gód of his salvátion.
6 This is the generation of thém that séek him; * even of them that seek thy face, O Gód of Jácob.
7 Lift up your heads, O ye gates; † and be ye lift up, ye everlásting dóors; * and the King of glory sháll
come ín.
8 Who is this Kíng of glóry? * It is the LORD strong and mighty, even the LORD míghty in báttle.
9 Lift up your heads, O ye gates;† and be ye lift up, ye everlásting dóors; * and the King of glory sháll
come ín.
10 Who is this Kíng of glóry? * Even the LORD of hosts, he is the Kíng of glóry.

12 As it was in the beginning, † is now, and éver sháll be, * world wíthout énd.
 Amen.
Psalm 25. Ad te, Domine, levavi.
UNTO thee, O LORD, will I lift up my soul; † my God, I have put my trúst in thée: * O let me not be
confounded, neither let mine enemies tríumph over mé.
2 For all they that hope in thee shall nót be ashámed; * but such as transgress without a cause shall be pút to
confúsion.
3 Show me thy wáys, O LÓRD, * and teach mé thy páths.
4 Lead me forth in thy trúth, and léarn me: * for thou art the God of my salvation; in thee hath been my
hópe all the day lóng.
5 Call to remembrance, O LORD, thy ténder mércies, * and thy loving-kindnesses, which have been éver of
óld.
6 O remember not the sins and offénces of my yóuth; * but according to thy mercy think thou upon me, O
LÓRD, for thy góodness.
7 Gracious and ríghteous is the LÓRD; * therefore, will he teach sínners in the wáy.
8 Them that are meek shall he gúide in júdgment; * and such as are gentle, them shall he léarn his wáy.
9 All the paths of the LORD are mércy and trúth, * unto such as keep his cóvenant and his téstimonies.
10 For thy Name’s sáke, O LÓRD, * be merciful unto my sín; for it is gréat.
11 What man is he that féareth the LÓRD? * him shall he teach in the wáy that he shall chóose.
12 His soul shall dwéll at éase, * and his seed shall inhérit the lánd.
13 The secret of the LORD is among thém that fear hím; * and he will shów them his cóvenant.
14 Mine eyes are ever looking únto the LÓRD; * for he shall pluck my feet óut of the nét.
15 Turn thee unto me, and have mércy upon mé; * for I am désolate, and in mísery. 
16 The sorrows of my héart are enlárged: * O bring thou me óut of my tróubles.
17 Look upon my advérsity and mísery, * and forgive me áll my sín.
18 Consider mine enemies, how mány they áre; * and they bear a tyrannous háte against mé.
19 O keep my soul, and delíver mé: * let me not be confounded, for I have put my trúst in thée.
20 Let perfectness and righteous dealing wáit upon mé; * for my hope hath béen in thée.
21 Deliver Ísrael, O Gód, * out of áll his tróubles.
22 Glory be to the Father, and tó the Són, * and to the Hóly Ghóst;
23 As it was in the beginning, † is now, and éver sháll be, * world wíthout énd.

Psalm 26. Judica me, Domine.
BE thou my Judge, O LORD, for I háve walked ínnocently: * my trust hath been also in the LORD, therefore
shall Í not fáll.
2 Examine me, O LÓRD, and próve me; * try out my réins and my héart.
3 For thy loving-kindness is ever befóre mine éyes; * and I will wálk in thy trúth.
4 I have not dwélt with vain pérsons; * neither will I have fellowship wíth the decéitful.
5 I have hated the congregátion of the wícked; * and will not sit amóng the ungódly.
6 I will wash my hands in ínnocency, O LÓRD; * and so will I gó to thine áltar;
7 That I may show the vóice of thanksgíving, * and tell of all thy wóndrous wórks.
8 LORD, I have loved the habitátion of thy hóuse, * and the place where thine hónor dwélleth.
9 O shut not up my sóul with the sínners, * nor my lífe with the blóodthirsty;
10 In whose hánds is wíckedness, * and their right hand is fúll of gífts.
11 But as for me, I wíll walk ínnocently: * O deliver me, and be mérciful unto mé.
12 My foot stándeth ríght: * I will praise the LÓRD in the congregátions.
13 Glory be to the Father, and tó the Són, * and to the Hóly Ghóst;
14 As it was in the beginning, † is now, and éver sháll be, * world wíthout énd.
 Amen.
Evening Prayer
Psalm 27. Dominus illuminatio.
THE LORD is my light and my salvation; whom then sháll I féar? * the LORD is the strength of my life; of
whom then shall Ī be afráid?
2 When the wicked, even mine enemies and my foes, came upon me to éat up my flésh, * they stúmbled
and féll.
3 Though an host of men were laid against me, † yet shall not my héart be afráid; * and though there rose
up war against me, yet will I put my trúst in hím.
4 One thing have I desired of the LORD, which Ī will reqúire; * even that I may dwell in the house of the
LORD all the days of my life, to behold the fair beauty of the LORD, and to vísit his témple.
5 For in the time of trouble he shall híde me in his tábernacle; * yea, in the secret place of his dwelling shall
he hide me, and set me up upon a róck of stóne.
6 And now shall he líft up mine héad * above mine enemies róund about mé.
7 Therefore will I offer in his dwelling an oblation, wíth great gládness: * I will sing and speak práises unto
the LÓRD.
8 Harken unto my voice, O LORD, when I crÿ unto thée; * have mercy upón me, and héar me.
9 My heart hath talked of thee, Séek ye my fáce: * Thy face, LÓRD, will I séek.
10 O hide not thou thy fáce from mé, * nor cast thy servant awáy in displéasure.
11 Thou hast béen my súccor; * leave me not, neither forsake me, O Gód of my salvátion.
12 When my father and my móther forsáke me, * the LORD táketh me úp.
13 Teach me thy wáy, O LÓRD, * and lead me in the right way, becáuse of mine énemies.
14 Deliver me not over into the wíll of mine advérsaries: * for there are false witnesses risen up against me,
and súch as speak wróng.
15 I should útterly have fáinted, * but that I believe verily to see the goodness of the LORD in the lánd of
the líving.
16 O tarry thóu the LORD’s léisure; * be strong, and he shall comfort thine heart; and put thou thy trúst in
the LÓRD.
17 Glory be to the Father, and tó the Són, * and to the Hóly Ghóst;
18 As it was in the beginning, † is now, and éver sháll be, * world wíthout énd.
 Amen.
Psalm 28. Ad te, Domine. 
UNTO thee will I cry, O LÓRD, my stréngth: * think no scorn of me; lest, if thou make as though thou
hearest not, I become like them that go dówn into the pít.
2 Hear the voice of my humble petitions, when I crÿ unto thée; * when I hold up my hands towards the
mercy-seat of thy hóly témple.
3 O pluck me not away, neither destroy me with the ungodly and wícked dóers, * which speak friendly to
their neighbors, but imagine míschief in their héarts.
4 Reward them accórding to their déeds, * and according to the wickedness of their ówn invéntions.
5 Recompense them after the wórk of their hánds; * pay them that they háve desérved.
6 For they regard not in their mind the works of the LORD,† nor the operátion of his hánds; * therefore
shall he break them down, and not búild them úp.
7 Práised be the LÓRD; * for he hath heard the voice of my húmble petítions.
8 The LORD is my strength, and my shield; † my heart hath trusted in him, and Ī am hélped; * therefore my
heart danceth for joy, and in my song will Í praise hím.
9 The LÓRD is my stréngth, * and he is the wholesome defénse of his anóinted.
10 O save thy people, and give thy blessing unto thíne inhéritance: * feed them, and set them úp foréver.
11 Glory be to the Father, and tó the Són, * and to the Hóly Ghóst;
12 As it was in the beginning, † is now, and éver sháll be, * world wíthout énd.
 Amen.
Psalm 29. Afferte Domino.
ASCRIBE unto the LORD, Ó ye míghty, * ascribe unto the LORD wórship and stréngth.
2 Ascribe unto the LORD the honor due untó his Náme; * worship the LORD with hóly wórship.
3 The voice of the LORD is upón the wáters; * it is the glorious God that máketh the thúnder.
4 It is the LORD that ruleth the sea; † the voice of the LORD is míghty in operátion; * the voice of the LORD
is a glórious vóice.
5 The voice of the LORD breaketh the cédar trées; * yea, the LORD breaketh the cédars of Lébanon.
6 He maketh them also to skíp like a cálf; * Lebanon also, and Sirion, líke a young únicorn.
7 The voice of the LORD divideth the flames of fire; † the voice of the LORD sháketh the wílderness; * yea,
the LORD shaketh the wílderness of Kádesh.
8 The voice of the LORD maketh the hinds to bring forth young, and strippeth báre the fórests: * in his
temple doth every thing spéak of his hónor.
9 The LORD sitteth abóve the wáterflood, * and the LORD remaineth a Kíng foréver.
10 The LORD shall give stréngth unto his péople; * the LORD shall give his people the bléssing of péace.
11 Glory be to the Father, and tó the Són, * and to the Hóly Ghóst;
12 As it was in the beginning, † is now, and éver sháll be, * world wíthout énd.
 Amen.
THE SIXTH DAY
Morning Prayer
Psalm 30. Exaltabo te, Domine.
I WILL magnify thee, O LORD; for thou hast sét me úp, * and not made my foes to tríumph over mé.
2 O LORD my God, I críed unto thée; * and thóu hast héaled me.
3 Thou, LORD, hast brought my sóul out of héll: * thou hast kept my life, that I should not go dówn into the
pít.
4 Sing praises unto the LORD, O ye sáints of hís; * and give thanks unto him, for a remémbrance of his
hóliness.
5 For his wrath endureth but the twinkling of an eye, and in his pléasure is lífe; * heaviness may endure for
a night, but joy cómeth in the mórning.
6 And in my prosperity I said, I shall néver be remóved: * thou, LORD, of thy goodness, hast made my híll
so stróng.
7 Thou didst turn thy fáce from mé, * and Ī was tróubled.
8 Then cried I unto thée, O LÓRD; * and gat me to my LÓRD right húmbly.
9 What profit is thére in my blóod, * when I go dówn into the pít?
10 Shall the dust give thánks unto thée? * or shall it decláre thy trúth?
11 Hear, O LORD, and have mércy upon mé; * LORD, be thóu my hélper.
12 Thou hast turned my héaviness into jóy; * thou hast put off my sackcloth, and gírded me with gládness:
13 Therefore shall every good man sing of thy práise without céasing. * O my God, I will give thanks unto
thée foréver.
14 Glory be to the Father, and tó the Són, * and to the Hóly Ghóst;
15 As it was in the beginning, † is now, and éver sháll be, * world wíthout énd. 
 Amen.
Psalm 31. In te, Domine, speravi.
IN thee, O LORD, have I put my trust; † let me never be pút to confúsion; * deliver mé in thy ríghteousness.
2 Bow down thine éar to mé; * make haste to delíver mé.
3 And be thou my strong rock, and hóuse of defénse, * that thou máyest save mé.
4 For thou art my strong róck, and my cástle: * be thou also my guide, and lead me for thÿ Name’s sáke.
5 Draw me out of the net that they have laid prívily for mé; * for thóu art my stréngth.
6 Into thy hands I comménd my spírit; * for thou hast redeemed me, O LORD, thou Gód of trúth.
7 I have hated them that hold of lÿing vánities, * and my trust hath béen in the LÓRD.
8 I will be glad and rejóice in thy mércy; * for thou hast considered my trouble, and hast known my sóul in
advérsities.
9 Thou hast not shut me up into the hánd of the énemy; * but hast set my féet in a large róom.
10 Have mercy upon me, O LORD, for Ī am in tróuble, * and mine eye is consumed for very heaviness; yea,
my sóul and my bódy.
11 For my life is waxen óld with héaviness, * and my yéars with móurning.
12 My strength faileth me, because of míne iníquity, * and my bónes are consúmed.
13 I became a reproach among all mine enemies, but especially amóng my néighbors; * and they of mine
acquaintance were afraid of me; and they that did see me without, conveyed themsélves from mé.
14 I am clean forgotten as a dead man óut of mínd; * I am become like a bróken véssel.
15 For I have heard the blasphemy of the multitude, and fear is on évery síde; * while they conspire
together against me, and take their counsel to take awáy my lífe.
16 But my hope hath been in thée, O LÓRD; * I have said, Thou árt my Gód.
17 My times are in thy hand; deliver me from the hánd of mine énemies, * and from them that pérsecute
mé.
18 Show thy servant the líght of thy cóuntenance, * and save me for thy mércy’s sáke.
19 Let me not be confounded, O LORD, for I have cálled upon thée; * let the ungodly be put to confusion,
and be put to sílence in the gráve.
20 Let the lying lips be pút to sílence, * which cruelly, disdainfully, and despitefully speak agáinst the
ríghteous.
21 O how plentiful is thy goodness, which thou hast laid up for thém that fear thée, * and that thou hast
prepared for them that put their trust in thee, even before the sóns of mén!
22 Thou shalt hide them in the covert of thine own presence from the plóttings of mén: * thou shalt keep
them secretly in thy tabernacle from the strífe of tóngues.
23 Thanks be tó the LÓRD; * for he hath showed me marvelous great kíndness in a strong cíty.
24 But in my háste I sáid, * I am cast out of the síght of thine éyes.
25 Nevertheless, thou heardest the vóice of my práyer, * when I críed unto thée.
26 O love the LORD, all yé his sáints; * for the LORD preserveth them that are faithful, and plenteously
rewárdeth the proud dóer.
27 Be strong, and he shall estáblish your héart, * all ye that put your trúst in the LÓRD.
28 Glory be to the Father, and tó the Són, * and to the Hóly Ghóst;
29 As it was in the beginning, † is now, and éver sháll be, * world wíthout énd.
 Amen.
Psalm 32. Beati quorum.
BLESSED is he whose unríghteousness is forgíven, * and whose sín is cóvered.
2 Blessed is the man unto whom the LORD impúteth no sín, * and in whose spirit there ís no guíle.
3 For whilst I héld my tóngue, * my bones consumed away through my dáily compláining.
4 For thy hand was heavy upon me dáy and níght, * and my moisture was like the droúght in súmmer.
5 I acknowledged my sín unto theé; * and mine unrighteousness háve I not híd.
6 I said, I will confess my síns unto the Lórd; * and so thou forgavest the wíckedness of my sín.
7 For this shall every one that is godly make his prayer unto thee, † in a time when thou máyest be fóund; *
surely the great waterfloods shall nót come nígh him.
8 Thou art a place to hide me in; † thou shalt presérve me from tróuble; * thou shalt compass me about with
sóngs of delíverance.
9 I will inform thee, and teach thee in the wáy wherein thou shalt gó; * and I will guíde thee with mine éye.
10 Be ye not like to horse and mule, † which have no únderstánding; * whose mouths must be held with bit
and bridle, else they will nót obéy thee.
11 Great plagues remáin for the ungódly; * but whoso putteth his trust in the LORD, mercy embraceth him
on évery síde. 
12 Be glad, O ye righteous, and rejóice in the LÓRD; * and be joyful, all ye that are trúe of heárt.
13 Glory be to the Father, and tó the Són, * and to the Hóly Ghóst;
14 As it was in the beginning, is now, and éver sháll be, * world wíthout énd.
 Amen.
Psalm 33. Exultate, justi.
REJOICE in the LÓRD, O ye ríghteous; * for it becometh well the júst to be thánkful.
2 Praise the LÓRD with hárp; * sing praises unto him with the lute, and ínstrument of tén strings.
3 Sing únto the Lórd a new sóng; * sing práises lústily unto hím with a good cóurage.
4 For the word of the LÓRD is trúe; * and all his wórks are fáithful.
5 He loveth ríghteousness and júdgment; * the earth is full of the góodness of the LÓRD.
6 By the word of the LORD were the héavens máde; * and all the host of them by the bréath of his móuth.
7 He gathereth the waters of the sea together, as it were upón an héap; * and layeth up the deep, as in a
tréasure-hóuse.
8 Let all the earth féar the LÓRD: * stand in awe of him, all ye that dwéll in the wórld.
9 For he spake, and ít was dóne; * he commanded, and ít stood fást.
10 The LORD bringeth the counsel of the héathen to nóught, * and maketh the devices of the people to be of
none effect, and casteth out the cóunsels of prínces.
11 The counsel of the LORD shall endúre foréver, * and the thoughts of his heart from generátion to
generátion.
12 Blessed are the people whose God is the Lórd JEHÓVAH; * and blessed are the folk that he hath chosen
to him, to bé his inhéritance.
13 The LORD looketh down from heaven, and beholdeth all the chíldren of mén; * from the habitation of
his dwelling, he considereth all them that dwéll on the éarth.
14 He fashioneth all the heárts of thém, * and understandeth áll their wórks.
15 There is no king that can be saved by the múltitude of an hóst; * neither is any mighty man delívered by
much stréngth.
16 A horse is counted but a vain thing to sáve a mán; * neither shall he deliver any mán by his great
stréngth.
17 Behold, the eye of the LORD is upón them that féar him, * and upon them that put their trúst in his mércy;
18 To deliver their sóul from déath, * and to feed them in the tíme of déarth.
19 Our soul hath patiently tárried for the LÓRD; * for he is our hélp and our shíeld.
20 For our heart shall rejóice in hím; * because we have hoped in his hóly Náme.
21 Let thy merciful kindness, O LÓRD, be upón us, * like as we do put our trúst in theé.
22 Glory be to the Father, and tó the Són, * and to the Hóly Ghóst;
23 As it was in the beginning, is now, and éver sháll be, * world wíthout énd.
 Amen.
Psalm 34. Benedicam Dominum.
I WILL alway give thánks unto the LÓRD ; * his praise shall ever be ín my móuth.
2 My soul shall make her bóast in the LÓRD; * the humble shall héar thereof, and be glád.
3 O praise the LÓRD with mé, * and let us magnify his Náme togéther.
4 I sought the LÓRD, and he héard me; * yea, he delivered me out of áll my féar.
5 They had an eye unto hím, and were líghtened; * and their faces were nót ashámed.
6 Lo, the poor crieth, and the LORD héareth hím; * yea, and saveth him out of áll his tróubles.
7 The angel of the LORD tarrieth round about thém that féar him, * and delívereth thém.
8 O taste, and see, how grácious the LÓRD is: * blessed is the man that trústeth in hím.
9 O fear the LORD, ye that áre his sáints; * for they that féar him lack nóthing.
10 The lions do lack, and súffer húnger; * but they who seek the LORD shall want no manner of thíng that is
góod.
11 Come, ye children, and hárken unto mé; * I will teach you the féar of the LÓRD.
12 What man is he that lústeth to líve, * and would fáin see good dáys?
13 Keep thy tóngue from évil, * and thy lips, that they spéak no guíle.
14 Eschew evil, and dó góod; * seek péace, and ensúe it.
15 The eyes of the LORD are óver the ríghteous, * and his ears are open únto their práyers.
16 The countenánce of the LORD is against thém that do évil, * to root out the remembrance of thém from
the éarth.
17 The righteous cry, and the LORD héareth thém, * and delivereth them out of áll their tróubles.
18 The LORD is nigh unto them that are of a cóntrite héart, * and will save such as be of an húmble spírit. 
19 Great are the tróubles of the ríghteous; * but the LORD delivereth him óut of áll.
20 He keepeth áll his bónes, * so that not one of thém is bróken.
21 But misfortune shall sláy the ungódly; * and they that hate the ríghteous shall be désolate.
22 The LORD delivereth the sóuls of his sérvants; * and all they that put their trust in him shall nót be
déstitute.
23 Glory be to the Father, and tó the Són, * and to the Hóly Ghóst;
24 As it was in the beginning, is now, and éver sháll be, * world wíthout énd.
 Amen.
THE SEVENTH DAY
Morning Prayer
Psalm 35. Judica, Domine.
PLEAD thou my cause, O LORD, with thém that stríve with me, * and fight thou against them that fíght
agáinst me.
2 Lay hand upon the shíeld and búckler, * and stánd up to hélp me.
3 Bring forth the spear, and stop the way against thém that pursúe me: * say unto my soul, I am thý
salvátion.
4 Let them be confounded, and put to shame, that seek áfter my sóul; * let them be turned back, and
brought to confusion, that imagine míschief fór me.
5 Let them be as the dúst befóre the wind, * and the angel of the LÓRD scáttering them.
6 Let their way be dárk and slíppery, * and let the angel of the LÓRD pursúe them.
7 For they have privily laid their net to destroy me withóut a cáuse; * yea, even without a cause have they
made a pít for mý soul.
8 Let a sudden destruction come upon him unawares,† and his net that he hath laid prívily cátch himself; *
that he may fall ínto his own míschief.
9 And my soul shall be jóyful in the LÓRD; * it shall rejoice in hís salvátion.
10 All my bones shall say, Lord, who is like unto thee,† who deliverest the poor from him that ís too stróng
for him; * yea, the poor, and him that is in misery, from hím that spoileth him?
11 False wítnesses did rise up: * they laid to my charge thíngs that I knéw not.
12 They rewarded me évil for góod, * to the great discómfort óf my soul.
13 Nevertheless, when they were sick, I put on sackcloth, and humbled my sóul with fásting; * and my
prayer shall turn into míne own bósom.
14 I behaved myself as though it had been my fríend or my bróther; * I went heavily, as one that móurneth
for his móther.
15 But in mine adversity they rejoiced, and gathered themsélves togéther; * yea, the very abjects came
together against me unawares, making móuths at me, and céased not.
16 With the flatterers were búsy móckers, * who gnashed upon mé with théir teeth.
17 Lord, how long wilt thou lóok upón this? * O deliver my soul from the calamities which they bring on
me, and my dárling from the líons.
18 So will I give thee thanks in the great cóngregátion; * I will praise thee amóng much péople.
19 O let not them that are mine enemies triumph over mé ungódly; * neither let them wink with their eyes,
that hate mé withóut a cause.
20 And why? their communing is nót for péace; * but they imagine deceitful words against them that are
quíet ín the land.
21 They gaped upon me with their móuths, and sáid, * Fie on thee! fie on thee! we saw it wíth our éyes.
22 This thou hast séen, O LÓRD; * hold not thy tongue then; go not fár from mé, O Lord.
23 Awake, and stand up to júdge my quárrel; * avenge thou my cause, my Gód and mý Lord.
24 Judge me, O LORD my God, according to thy ríghteousnéss; * and let them not tríumph óver me.
25 Let them not say in their hearts, There! there! so wóuld we háve it; * neither let them say, We háve
devóured him.
26 Let them be put to confusion and shame together, that rejóice at my tróuble; * let them be clothed with
rebuke and dishonor, that boast themsélves agáinst me.
27 Let them be glad and rejoice, that favor my ríghteous déaling; * yea, let them say alway, Blessed be the
LORD, who hath pleasure in the prospérity of his sérvant.
28 And as for my tongue, it shall be talking of thy ríghteousnéss, * and of thy praise, áll the dáy long.
29 Glory be to the Father, and tó the Són, * and to the Hóly Ghóst;
30 As it was in the beginning, is now, and éver sháll be, * world wíthout énd.
 Amen.
Psalm 36. Dixit injustus. 
MY heart showeth me the wickedness of thé ungódly, * that there is no fear of Gód befóre his eyes.
2 For he flattereth himself in hís own síght, * until his abominable sín be fóund out.
3 The words of his mouth are unrighteous and fúll of decéit: * he hath left off to behave himself wisely, ánd
to dó good.
4 He imagineth mischief upon his bed, and hath set himself in nó góod way; * neither doth he abhor any
thíng that ís evil.
5 Thy mercy, O LORD, reacheth únto the héavens, * and thy faithfulness únto the clóuds.
6 Thy righteousness standeth like thé strong móuntains: * thy judgments are líke the gréat deep.
7 Thou, LORD, shalt save both man and beast:† how excellent ís thy mércy, O God! * and the children of
men shall put their trust under the shádow of thy wíngs.
8 They shall be satisfied with the plénteousness óf thy house; * and thou shalt give them drink of thy
pleasures, as óut of the ríver.
9 For with thee is the wéll of lífe; * and in thy líght shall we sée light.
10 O continue forth thy loving-kindness unto thém that knów thee, * and thy righteousness unto them that
are trúe of héart.
11 O let not the foot of pride cóme agáinst me; * and let not the hand of the ungódly cást me down.
12 There are they fallen,† all thát work wíckedness; * they are cast down, and shall not be áble to stánd.
13 Glory be to the Father, and tó the Són, * and to the Hóly Ghóst;
14 As it was in the beginning, is now, and éver sháll be, * world wíthout énd.
 Amen.
Evening Prayer
Psalm 37.
I. Noli aemulari.
FRET not thyself becáuse of the ungódly; * neither be thou envious against the évil dóers.
2 For they shall soon be cut dówn like the gráss, * and be withered éven as the gréen herb.
3 Put thou thy trust in the LORD, ánd be dóing good; * dwell in the land, and verily thóu shalt bé fed.
4 Delight thóu in the LÓRD, * and he shall give thée thy héart’s desire.
5 Commit thy way unto the LORD, and pút thy trúst in him, * and he shall bríng it tó pass.
6 He shall make thy righteousness as cléar as the líght, * and thy just dealing ás the nóonday.
7 Hold thee still in the LORD, and abide pátiently upón him: * but grieve not thyself at him whose way doth
prosper, against the man that doeth after évil cóunsels.
8 Leave off from wrath, and let gó displéasure: * fret not thyself, else shalt thou be móved to do évil.
9 Wicked doers sháll be róoted out; * and they that patiently abide the LORD, those shall inhérit the lánd.
10 Yet a little while, and the ungodly shall be cléan góne: * thou shalt look after his place, and he shall bé
awáy.
11 But the meek-spirited shall posséss the éarth, * and shall be refreshed in the múltitude of péace.
12 The ungodly seeketh counsel agáinst the júst, * and gnasheth upon hím with his téeth.
13 The Lord shall láugh him to scórn; * for he hath seen that his dáy is cóming.
14 The ungodly have drawn out the sword, and have bént their bów, * to cast down the poor and needy, and
to slay such as be úpright in their wáys.
15 Their sword shall go through théir own héart, * and their bów shall be bróken.
16 A small thing that the ríghteous háth, * is better than great ríches of the ungódly.
17 For the arms of the ungódly shall be bróken, * and the LORD uphóldeth the ríghteous.
18 The LORD knoweth the dáys of the gódly; * and their inheritance shall endúre foréver.
Glory be to the Father, and tó the Són, * and to the Hóly Ghóst;
As it was in the beginning, † is now, and éver sháll be, * world wíthout énd.
 Amen.
II. Non Confundentur
THEY shall not be confounded in the périlous tíme; * and in the days of dearth they shall háve enóugh.
20 As for the ungodly, they shall perish, † and the enemies of the LORD shall consume as the fát of lámbs: *
yea, even as the smoke shall they consúme awáy.
21 The ungodly borroweth, and páyeth not agáin; * but the righteous is mérciful and líberal.
22 Such as are blessed of God, shall posséss the lánd; * and they that are cursed of him, shall be róoted óut.
23 The LORD ordereth a góod man’s góing, * and maketh his way accéptable to himsélf.
24 Though he fall, he shall not be cást awáy; * for the LORD uphóldeth hím with his hand.
25 I have been young, and nów am óld; * and yet saw I never the righteous forsaken, nor his séed bégging
their bread.
26 The righteous is ever mérciful, and léndeth; * and his séed is bléssèd. 
27 Flee from evil, and do the thíng that is góod; * and dwéll forévermore.
28 For the LORD loveth the thíng that is ríght; * he forsaketh not his that be godly, but they are presérved
foréver.
29 The unríghteous shall be púnished; * as for the seed of the ungodly, it shall be róoted óut.
30 The righteous shall inhérit the lánd, * and dwell thereín foréver.
31 The mouth of the righteous is éxercised in wísdom, * and his tongue will be tálking of júdgment.
32 The law of his Gód is in his héart, * and his góings shall not slíde.
33 The ungodly wátcheth the righteous, * and seeketh occásion to sláy him.
34 The LORD will not léave him in his hánd, * nor condemn him when hé is júdged.
35 Hope thou in the LORD, and keep his way, † and he shall promote thee, that thou shalt posséss the lánd:
* when the ungodly shall pérish, thou shalt sée it.
36 I myself have seen the ungódly in great pówer, * and flourishing líke a gréen bay tree.
37 I went by, and ló, he was góne: * I sought him, but his place could nó where be fóund.
38 Keep innocency, and take heed unto the thíng that is ríght; * for that shall bring a man péace at the lást.
39 As for the transgressors, they shall pérish togéther; * and the end of the ungodly is, they shall be róoted
out at the lást.
40 But the salvation of the righteous cómeth of the LÓRD; * who is also their stréngth in the tíme of trouble.
41 And the LORD shall stand by them, and sáve thém: * he shall deliver them from the ungodly, and shall
save them, because they pút their trúst in him.
42 Glory be to the Father, and tó the Són, * and to the Hóly Ghóst;
43 As it was in the beginning, † is now, and éver sháll be, * world wíthout énd.
 Amen.
THE EIGHTH DAY
Morning Prayer
Psalm 38. Domine, ne in furore.
PUT me not to rebuke, O LORD, ín thine ánger; * neither chasten me in thy héavy displéasure:
2 For thine arrows stick fást in mé, * and thy hand présseth me sóre.
3 There is no health in my flesh, because of thý displéasure; * neither is there any rest in my bones, by
réason óf my sin.
4 For my wickednesses are gone óver my héad, * and are like a sore burden, too héavy for mé to bear.
5 My wounds stink, and áre corrúpt, * thróugh my fóolishness.
6 I am brought into so great tróuble and mísery, * that I go mourning áll the dáy long.
7 For my loins are filled with a sóre diséase, * and there is no whole párt in my bódy.
8 I am féeble and sore smítten; * I have roared for the very disquíetness óf my heart.
9 Lord, thou knowest áll my désire; * and my groaning ís not híd from thee.
10 My heart panteth, my stréngth hath fáiled me, * and the light of mine éyes is góne from me.
11 My lovers and my neighbors did stand looking upón my tróuble, * and my kínsmen stóod afar off.
12 They also that sought after my lífe laid snáres for me; * and they that went about to do me evil talked of
wickedness, and imagined decéit all the dáy long.
13 As for me, I was like a deaf mán, and héard not; * and as one that is dumb, who doth not ópen his móuth.
14 I became even as a mán that héareth not, * and in whose móuth are nó reproofs.
15 For in thee, O LORD, have I pút my trúst; * thou shalt answer for me, O Lórd my Gód.
16 I have required that they, even mine enemies, should not tríumph óver me; * for when my foot slipped,
they rejoíced greatly agáinst me.
17 And I truly am sét in the plágue, * and my heaviness is éver ín my sight.
18 For I will conféss my wíckedness, * and be sórry fór my sin.
19 But mine enemies líve, and are míghty; * and they that hate me wrongfully are mány in númber.
20 They also that reward evil for good áre agáinst me; * because I follow the thíng that góod is.
21 Forsake me not, O LÓRD my Gód; * be not thóu fár from me.
22 Haste thée to hélp me, * O Lord God of mý salvátion.
23 Glory be to the Father, and tó the Són, * and to the Hóly Ghóst;
24 As it was in the beginning, † is now, and éver sháll be, * world wíthout énd.
 Amen.
Psalm 39. Dixi, Custodiam.
I SAID, I will take héed to my wáys, * that I offend nót in my tóngue.
2 I will keep my mouth as it wére with a brídle, * while the ungódly is ín my síght.
3 I held my tongue, and spáke nóthing: * I kept silence, yea, even from good words; but it was páin and
gríef to me. 
4 My heart was hot within me: and while I was thus músing the fíre kíndled, * and at the last I spáke with
my tóngue:
5 LORD, let me know mine end, and the númber of my dáys; * that I may be certified how lóng I háve to
líve.
6 Behold, thou hast made my days as it were a span long, and mine age is even as nóthing in respéct of
thée; * and verily every man living is altogéther vánity.
7 For man walketh in a vain shadow, and disquieteth himsélf in váin; * he heapeth up riches, and cannot
tell whó shall gáther them.
8 And now, Lord, whát is my hópe? * truly my hópe is éven in thée.
9 Deliver me from áll mine offénces; * and make me not a rebúke unto the fóolish.
10 I became dumb, and ópened nót my móuth; * for ít was thy dóing.
11 Take thy plague awáy from mé: * I am even consumed by the méans of thy héavy hánd.
12 When thou with rebukes dost chasten man for sin, thou makest his beauty to consume away, like as it
were a móth frétting a gárment: * every man thérefore is bút vánity.
13 Hear my prayer, O LORD, and with thine ears consíder my cálling; * hold not thy péace at my téars;
14 For I am a stranger with thée, and a sojóurner, * as áll my fáthers were.
15 O spare me a little, that I may recóver my stréngth, * before I go hence, and be nó more séen.
16 Glory be to the Father, and tó the Són, * and to the Hóly Ghóst;
17 As it was in the beginning, † is now, and éver sháll be, * world wíthout énd.
 Amen.
Psalm 40. Expectans expectavi.
I WAITED pátiently for the LÓRD, * and he inclined unto me, and héard my cálling.
2 He brought me also out of the horrible pit, óut of the míre and cláy, * and set my feet upon the rock, and
órdered my góings.
3 And he hath put a new sóng in my móuth, * even a thanksgíving únto our Gód.
4 Many shall sée it, and féar, * and shall put their trúst in the LÓRD.
5 Blessèd is the man that hath set his hópe in the LÓRD, * and turned not unto the proud, and to such as gó
abóut with líes.
6 O LORD my God, great are the wondrous works which thou hast done, like as be also thy thoughts, which
áre to ús-ward; * and yet there is no man that órdereth them únto thee.
7 If I should decláre them, and spéak of them, * they should be more than I am áble to expréss.
8 Sacrifice and óffering thou wóuldest not, * but mine éars hast thou ópened.
9 Burnt-offering and sacrifice for sin hast thou nót requíred: * then said I, Ló, I cóme;
10 In the volume of the book it is written of me, that I should fulfíll thy wíll, O my Gód: * I am content to
do it; yea, thy láw is withín my héart.
11 I have declared thy righteousness in the gréat congregátion: * lo, I will not refrain my lips, O LORD, and
thát thou knówest.
12 I have not hid thy righteousness withín my héart; * my talk hath been of thy truth, and of thý salvátion.
13 I have not kept back thy loving mércy and trúth * from the gréat congregátion.
14 Withdraw not thou thy mércy from mé, O LÓRD; * let thy loving-kindness and thy truth álway presérve
me.
15 For innumerable troubles are come about me; † my sins have taken such hold upon me, that I am not
áble to look úp; * yea, they are more in number than the hairs of my head, and my héart hath fáiled me.
16 O LORD, let it be thy pléasure to delíver me; * make háste, O LÓRD, to hélp me.
17 Let them be ashamed, and confounded together, that seek after my sóul to destróy it; * let them be
driven backward, and put to rebuke, that wísh me évil.
18 Let them be desolate, and rewárded with sháme, * that say unto me, Fíe upón thee! fíe upón thee!
19 Let all those that seek thee, be jóyful and glád in thee; * and let such as love thy salvation, say alway,
The LÓRD be práised.
20 As for me, I am póor and néedy; * but the Lórd cáreth for mé.
21 Thou art my hélper and redéemer; * make no long tárrying, Ó my Gód.
22 Glory be to the Father, and tó the Són, * and to the Hóly Ghóst;
23 As it was in the beginning, † is now, and éver sháll be, * world wíthout énd.
 Amen.
Evening Prayer
Psalm 41. Beatus qui intelligit.
BLESSED is he that consídereth the póor and néedy; * the LORD shall delíver him in the tíme of tróuble. 
2 The LORD preserve him, and keep him alive, that hé may be bléssed upon éarth; * and deliver not thou
hím into the wíll of his énemies.
3 The LORD comfort him when he lieth síck upón his béd; * make thou áll his béd in his síckness.
4 I said, LORD, bé mérciful únto me; * heal my soul, for Í have sínned agáinst thee.
5 Mine enemies spéak évil of me, * When shall he díe, and his náme pérish?
6 And if he come to sée me, he spéaketh vánity, * and his heart conceiveth falsehood within himself; and
when he cómeth forth, he télleth it.
7 All mine enemies whísper togéther agáinst me; * even against me do théy imágine this évil.
8 An evil disease, say they, cléaveth fást únto him; * and now that he lieth, he shall ríse úp no móre.
9 Yea, even mine own famíliar friénd whom I trústed, * who did also eat of my bread, hath láid great wáit
for mé.
10 But be thou mérciful únto me, O LÓRD; * raise thou me up agáin, and Í shall rewárd them.
11 By this I knów thou fávorest me, * that mine enemy dóth not tríumph agáinst me.
12 And in my innocency thóu uphóldest mé, * and shalt set me befóre thy fáce foréver.
13 Blessed be the LÓRD Gód of Ísrael, * wórld withóut end. Amén.
14 Glory be to the Father, and tó the Són, * and tóa the Hóly Ghóst;
15 As it was in the beginning, † is now, and éver sháll be, * world wíthout énd.
 Amen.
BOOK II
Psalm 42. Quemadmodum.
LIKE as the hart desíreth the wáter-bróoks, * so longeth my sóul after thée, O Gód.
2 My soul is athirst for God, yea, éven for the líving Gód: * when shall I come to appear befóre the
présence of Gód?
3 My tears have been my méat dáy and níght, * while they daily say unto me, Whére is nów thy Gód?
4 Now when I think thereupon, I póur out my héart by mysélf; * for I went with the multitude, and brought
them fórth into the hóuse of Gód;
5 In the vóice of práise and thánksgiving, * among súch as kéep hóly-day.
6 Why art thou so full of héaviness, Ó my sóul? * and why art thou so disquíeted wíthin mé?
7 O pút thy trúst in Gód; * for I will yet thank him, which is the help of my cóuntenánce, and my Gód.
8 My sóul is véxed wíthin me; * therefore will I remember thee from the land of Jórdan, from Hérmon and
the líttle hill.
9 One deep calleth another, becáuse of the nóise of thy wáterfloods; * all thy wáves and stórms are gone
óver me.
10 The LORD will grant his lóving-kíndness in the dáytime; * and in the night season will I sing of him, and
make my práyer unto the Gód of my lífe.
11 I will say unto the God of my strength, Whý hast thóu forgótten me? * why go I thus heavily, whíle the
énemy opprésseth me?
12 My bones are smitten asúnder as wíth a swórd, * while mine enemies that tróuble me cást me in the
téeth;
13 Namely, while they sáy dáily únto me, * Whére is nów thy Gód?
14 Why art thou so véxed, Ó my sóul? * and why art thóu so disquíeted withín me?
15 O pút thy trúst in Gód; * for I will yet thank him, which is the hélp of my cóuntenance, and my Gód.
16 Glory be to the Father, and tó the Són, * and to the Hóly Ghóst;
17 As it was in the beginning, † is now, and éver sháll be, * world wíthout énd.
 Amen.
Psalm 43. Judica me, Deus.
GIVE sentence with me, O God, and defend my cause agáinst the ungódly péople; * O delíver me from the
decéitful and wícked man.
2 For thou art the God of my strength; whý hast thou pút me fróm thee? * and why go I so héavily, while
the énemy opprésseth me?
3 O send out thy light and thy trúth, that théy may léad me, * and bring me unto thy hóly hill, and tó thy
dwélling;
4 And that I may go unto the altar of God, even unto the Gód of my jóy and gládness; * and upon the harp
will I give thánks unto thée, O Gód, my God.
5 Why art thóu so héavy, O my sóul? * and why art thóu so disquíeted withín me?
6 O pút thy trúst in Gód; * for I will yet give him thanks, which is the hélp of my cóuntenance, and my

THE NINTH DAY
Morning Prayer.
Psalm 44. Deus, auribus.
WE have heard with our ears, O Gód, our fáthers have tóld us * what thou hast dóne in their tíme of óld:
2 How thou hast driven out the heathen with thy hánd, and plánted our fáthers in; * how thou hast
destroyed the nations, and máde thy péople to flóurish.
3 For they gat not the lánd in posséssion through their ówn sword, * neither was it their ówn arm that
hélped thém;
4 But thy right hand, and thíne arm, and the líght of thy cóuntenance; * because thou hádst a fávor únto
them.
5 Thou árt my Kíng, O Gód; * send hélp únto Jácob.
6 Through thee will we óverthrów our énemies, * and in thy Name will we tread them únder that ríse up
agáinst us.
7 For I wíll not trúst in my bów, * it is nót my swórd that shall hélp me;
8 But it is thou that sávest ús from our énemies, * and púttest them to confúsion that háte us.
9 We make our bóast of Gód all day lóng, * and will práise thy Náme foréver.
10 But now thou art fár off, and púttest us to confúsion, * and góest not fórth with our ármies.
11 Thou makest us to túrn our bácks upon our énemies, * so that they which háte us spóil our góods.
12 Thou lettest us be éaten up líke shéep, * and hast scáttered us amóng the héathen.
13 Thou séllest thy péople for nóught, * and tákest no móney for them.
14 Thou makest ús to be rebúked of our néighbors, * to be laughed to scorn, and had in derision of thém
that are róund abóut us.
15 Thou makest us to be a býword amóng the nátions, * and that the péoples sháke their héads at us.
16 My confúsion is dáily befóre me, * and the sháme of my fáce hath cóvered me;
17 For the vóice of the slánderer and blasphémer, * for the énemy and avénger.
18 And though all this be come upon us, yét do we nót forgét thee, * nor behave oursélves frówardly in thy
cóvenant.
19 Our héart is nót turned báck, * neither our stéps gone óut of thy wáy;
20 No, not when thou hast smítten us into the pláce of drágons, * and covered us wíth the shádow of déath.
21 If we have forgotten the Name of our God, and hólden up our hánds to any stránge god, * shall not God
search it out? for he knóweth the very sécrets of the héart.
22 For thy sake álso are we kílled all the dáy long, * and are counted as shéep appóinted to be sláin.
23 Úp, Lord, why sléepest thóu? * awake, and be not ábsent from ús foréver.
24 Wherefore hídest thóu thy fáce, * and forgéttest our mísery and tróuble?
25 For our soul is brought low, éven únto the dúst; * our belly cláaveth únto the gróund.
26 Aríse, and hélp us, * and delíver us, for thy mércy’s sáke.
27 Glory be to the Father, and tó the Són, * and to the Hóly Ghóst;
28 As it was in the beginning, † is now, and éver sháll be, * world wíthout énd.
 Amen.
Psalm 45. Eructavit cor meum.
MY heart overfloweth with a good matter; I speak the things which I have made concerning the King. * My
tongue is the pen of a ready writer.
2 Thou art fairer than the children of men; * full of grace are thy lips, because God hath blessed thee
forever.
3 Gird thee with thy sword upon thy thigh, O thou Most Mighty, * according to thy worship and renown.
4 Good luck have thou with thine honor: * ride on, because of the word of truth, of meekness, and
righteousness; and thy right hand shall teach thee terrible things.
5 Thy arrows are very sharp in the heart of the King’s enemies, * and the people shall be subdued unto thee.
6 Thy seat, O God, endureth forever; * the scepter of thy kingdom is a right scepter.
7 Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated iniquity; * wherefore God, even thy God, hath anointed thee
with the oil of gladness above thy fellows.
8 All thy garments smell of myrrh, aloes, and cassia; * out of the ivory palaces, whereby they have made
thee glad.
9 Kings’ daughters are among thy honorable women; * upon thy right hand doth stand the queen in a
vesture of gold, wrought about with divers colors.
10 Harken, O daughter, and consider; incline thine ear; * forget also thine own people, and thy father’s
house. 
11 So shall the King have pleasure in thy beauty; * for he is thy Lord, and worship thou him.
12 And the daughter of Tyre shall be there with a gift; * like as the rich also among the people shall make
their supplication before thee.
13 The King’s daughter is all glorious within; * her clothing is of wrought gold.
14 She shall be brought unto the King in raiment of needlework: * the virgins that be her fellows shall bear
her company, and shall be brought unto thee.
15 With joy and gladness shall they be brought, * and shall enter into the King’s palace.
16 Instead of thy fathers, thou shalt have children, * whom thou mayest make princes in all lands.
17 I will make thy Name to be remembered from one generation to another; * therefore shall the people
give thanks unto thee, world without end.
18 Glory be to the Father, and tó the Són, * and to the Hóly Ghóst;
19 As it was in the beginning, † is now, and éver sháll be, * world wíthout énd.
 Amen.
Psalm 46. Deus noster refugium.
GOD is our hope and strength, * a very present help in trouble.
2 Therefore will we not fear, though the earth be moved, * and though the hills be carried into the midst of
the sea;
3 Though the waters thereof rage and swell, * and though the mountains shake at the tempest of the same.
4 There is a river, the streams whereof make glad the city of God; * the holy place of the tabernacle of the
Most Highest.
5 God is in the midst of her, therefore shall she not be removed; * God shall help her, and that right early.
6 The nations make much ado, and the kingdoms are moved; * but God hath showed his voice, and the
earth shall melt away.
7 The LORD of hosts is with us; * the God of Jacob is our refuge.
8 O come hither, and behold the works of the LORD, * what destruction he hath brought upon the earth.
9 He maketh wars to cease in all the world; * he breaketh the bow, and knappeth the spear in sunder, and
burneth the chariots in the fire.
10 Be still then, and know that I am God: * I will be exalted among the nations, and I will be exalted in the
earth.
11 The LORD of hosts is with us; * the God of Jacob is our refuge.
12 Glory be to the Father, and tó the Són, * and to the Hóly Ghóst;
13 As it was in the beginning, † is now, and éver sháll be, * world wíthout énd.
 Amen.
Evening Prayer.
Psalm 47. Omnes gentes, plaudite.
O CLAP your hands together, all ye peoples: * O sing unto God with the voice of melody.
2 For the LORD is high, and to be feared; * he is the great King upon all the earth.
3 He shall subdue the peoples under us, * and the nations under our feet.
4 He shall choose out an heritage for us, * even the excellency of Jacob, whom he loved.
5 God is gone up with a merry noise, * and the LORD with the sound of the trump.
6 O sing praises, sing praises unto our God; * O sing praises, sing praises unto our King.
7 For God is the King of all the earth: * sing ye praises with understanding.
8 God reigneth over the nations; * God sitteth upon his holy seat.
9 The princes of the peoples are joined unto the people of the God of Abraham; * for God, which is very
high exalted, doth defend the earth, as it were with a shield.
10 Glory be to the Father, and tó the Són, * and to the Hóly Ghóst;
11 As it was in the beginning, † is now, and éver sháll be, * world wíthout énd.
 Amen.
Psalm 48. Magnus Dominus.
GREAT is the LORD, and highly to be praised * in the city of our God, even upon his holy hill.
2 The hill of Sion is a fair place, and the joy of the whole earth; * upon the north side lieth the city of the
great King: God is well known in her palaces as a sure refuge.
3 For lo, the kings of the earth * were gathered, and gone by together.
4 They marvelled to see such things; * they were astonished, and suddenly cast down.
5 Fear came there upon them; and sorrow, * as upon a woman in her travail.
6 Thou dost break the ships of the sea * through the east-wind.
7 Like as we have heard, so have we seen in the city of the LORD of hosts, in the city of our God; * God
upholdeth the same forever. 
8 We wait for thy loving-kindness, O God, * in the midst of thy temple.
9 O God, according to thy Name, so is thy praise unto the world’s end; * thy right hand is full of
righteousness.
10 Let the mount Sion rejoice, and the daughters of Judah be glad, * because of thy judgments.
11 Walk about Sion, and go round about her; * and tell the towers thereof.
12 Mark well her bulwarks, consider her palaces, * that ye may tell them that come after.
13 For this God is our God for ever and ever: * he shall be our guide unto death.
14 Glory be to the Father, and tó the Són, * and to the Hóly Ghóst;
15 As it was in the beginning, † is now, and éver sháll be, * world wíthout énd.
 Amen.
Psalm 49. Audite haec, omnes.
O HEAR ye this, all ye people; * ponder it with your ears, all ye that dwell in the world;
2 High and low, rich and poor, * one with another.
3 My mouth shall speak of wisdom, * and my heart shall muse of understanding.
4 I will incline mine ear to the parable, * and show my dark speech upon the harp.
5 Wherefore should I fear in the days of evil, * when wickedness at my heels compasseth me round about?
6 There be some that put their trust in their goods, * and boast themselves in the multitude of their riches.
7 But no man may deliver his brother, * nor give a ransom unto God for him,
8 (For it cost more to redeem their souls, * so that he must let that alone forever;)
9 That he shall live alway, * and not see the grave.
10 For he seeth that wise men also die and perish together, * as well as the ignorant and foolish, and leave
their riches for other.
11 And yet they think that their houses shall continue forever, and that their dwelling-places shall endure
from one generation to another; * and call the lands after their own names.
12 Nevertheless, man being in honor abideth not, * seeing he may be compared unto the beasts that perish;
13 This their way is very foolishness; * yet their posterity praise their saying.
14 They lie in the grave like sheep; death is their shepherd; and the righteous shall have dominion over
them in the morning: * their beauty shall consume in the sepulchre, and have no abiding.
15 But God hath delivered my soul from the power of the grave; * for he shall receive me.
16 Be not thou afraid, though one be made rich, * or if the glory of his house be increased;
17 For he shall carry nothing away with him when he dieth, * neither shall his pomp follow him.
18 For while he lived, he counted himself an happy man; * and so long as thou doest well unto thyself, men
will speak good of thee.
19 He shall follow the generation of his fathers, * and shall never see light.
20 Man that is in honor but hath no understanding * is compared unto the beasts that perish.
21 Glory be to the Father, and tó the Són, * and to the Hóly Ghóst;
22 As it was in the beginning, † is now, and éver sháll be, * world wíthout énd.
 Amen.
THE TENTH DAY
Morning Prayer.
Psalm 50. Deus deorum.
THE LORD, even the Most Mighty God, hath spoken, * and called the world, from the rising up of the sun
unto the going down thereof.
2 Out of Sion hath God appeared * in perfect beauty.
3 Our God shall come, and shall not keep silence; * there shall go before him a consuming fire, and a
mighty tempest shall be stirred up round about him.
4 He shall call the heaven from above, * and the earth, that he may judge his people.
5 Gather my saints together unto me; * those that have made a covenant with me with sacrifice.
6 And the heavens shall declare his righteousness; * for God is Judge himself.
7 Hear, O my people, and I will speak; * I myself will testify against thee, O Israel; for I am God, even thy
God.
8 I will not reprove thee because of thy sacrifices; * as for thy burnt-offerings, they are alway before me.
9 I will take no bullock out of thine house, * nor he-goats out of thy folds.
10 For all the beasts of the forest are mine, * and so are the cattle upon a thousand hills.
11 I know all the fowls upon the mountains, * and the wild beasts of the field are in my sight.
12 If I be hungry, I will not tell thee; * for the whole world is mine, and all that is therein.
13 Thinkest thou that I will eat bulls’ flesh, * and drink the blood of goats?
14 Offer unto God thanksgiving, * and pay thy vows unto the Most Highest.
15 And call upon me in the time of trouble; * so will I hear thee, and thou shalt praise me. 
16 But unto the ungodly saith God, * Why dost thou preach my laws, and takest my covenant in thy mouth;
17 Whereas thou hatest to be reformed, * and hast cast my words behind thee?
18 When thou sawest a thief, thou consentedst unto him; * and hast been partaker with the adulterers.
19 Thou hast let thy mouth speak wickedness, * and with thy tongue thou hast set forth deceit.
20 Thou sattest and spakest against thy brother; * yea, and hast slandered thine own mother’s son.
21 These things hast thou done, and I held my tongue, and thou thoughtest wickedly, that I am even such a
one as thyself; * but I will reprove thee, and set before thee the things that thou hast done.
22 O consider this, ye that forget God, * lest I pluck you away, and there be none to deliver you.
23 Whoso offereth me thanks and praise, he honoreth me; * and to him that ordereth his way aright, will I
show the salvation of God.
24 Glory be to the Father, and tó the Són, * and to the Hóly Ghóst;
25 As it was in the beginning, † is now, and éver sháll be, * world wíthout énd.
 Amen.
Psalm 51. Miserere mei, Deus.
HAVE mercy upon me, O God, after thy great goodness; * according to the multitude of thy mercies do
away mine offences.
2 Wash me throughly from my wickedness, * and cleanse me from my sin.
3 For I acknowledge my faults, * and my sin is ever before me.
4 Against thee only have I sinned, and done this evil in thy sight; * that thou mightest be justified in thy
saying, and clear when thou shalt judge.
5 Behold, I was shapen in wickedness, * and in sin hath my mother conceived me.
6 But lo, thou requirest truth in the inward parts, * and shalt make me to understand wisdom secretly.
7 Thou shalt purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean; * thou shalt wash me, and I shall be whiter than
snow.
8 Thou shalt make me hear of joy and gladness, * that the bones which thou hast broken may rejoice.
9 Turn thy face from my sins, * and put out all my misdeeds.
10 Make me a clean heart, O God, * and renew a right spirit within me.
11 Cast me not away from thy presence, * and take not thy holy Spirit from me.
12 O give me the comfort of thy help again, * and stablish me with thy free Spirit.
13 Then shall I teach thy ways unto the wicked, * and sinners shall be converted unto thee.
14 Deliver me from blood-guiltiness, O God, thou that art the God of my health; * and my tongue shall sing
of thy righteousness.
15 Thou shalt open my lips, O Lord, * and my mouth shall show thy praise.
16 For thou desirest no sacrifice, else would I give it thee; * but thou delightest not in burnt-offerings.
17 The sacrifice of God is a troubled spirit: * a broken and contrite heart, O God, shalt thou not despise.
18 O be favorable and gracious unto Sion; * build thou the walls of Jerusalem.
19 Then shalt thou be pleased with the sacrifice of righteousness, with the burnt-offerings and oblations; *
then shall they offer young bullocks upon thine altar.
20 Glory be to the Father, and tó the Són, * and to the Hóly Ghóst;
21 As it was in the beginning, † is now, and éver sháll be, * world wíthout énd.
 Amen.
Psalm 52. Quid gloriaris?
WHY boastest thou thyself, thou tyrant, * that thou canst do mischief;
2 Whereas the goodness of God * endureth yet daily?
3 Thy tongue imagineth wickedness, * and with lies thou cuttest like a sharp razor.
4 Thou hast loved unrighteousness more than goodness, * and falsehood more than righteousness.
5 Thou hast loved to speak all words that may do hurt, * O thou false tongue.
6 Therefore shall God destroy thee forever; * he shall take thee, and pluck thee out of thy dwelling, and
root thee out of the land of the living.
7 The righteous also shall see this, and fear, * and shall laugh him to scorn:
8 Lo, this is the man that took not God for his strength; * but trusted unto the multitude of his riches, and
strengthened himself in his wickedness.
9 As for me, I am like a green olive tree in the house of God; * my trust is in the tender mercy of God for
ever and ever.
10 I will alway give thanks unto thee for that thou hast done; * and I will hope in thy Name, for thy saints
like it well.
11 Glory be to the Father, and tó the Són, * and to the Hóly Ghóst;
12 As it was in the beginning, † is now, and éver sháll be, * world wíthout énd.
 Amen. 
Evening Prayer.
Psalm 53. Dixit insipiens.
THE foolish body hath said in his heart, * There is no God.
2 Corrupt are they, and become abominable in their wickedness; * there is none that doeth good.
3 God looked down from heaven upon the children of men, * to see if there were any that would
understand, and seek after God.
4 But they are all gone out of the way, they are altogether become abominable; * there is also none that
doeth good, no not one.
5 Are not they without understanding that work wickedness, * eating up my people as if they would eat
bread? they have not called upon God.
6 They were afraid where no fear was; * for God hath broken the bones of him that besieged thee; thou hast
put them to confusion, because God hath despised them.
7 O that the salvation were given unto Israel out of Sion! * O that the Lord would deliver his people out of
captivity!
8 Then should Jacob rejoice, * and Israel should be right glad.
9 Glory be to the Father, and tó the Són, * and to the Hóly Ghóst;
10 As it was in the beginning, † is now, and éver sháll be, * world wíthout énd.
 Amen.
Psalm 54. Deus, in Nomine.
SAVE me, O God, for thy Name’s sake, * and avenge me in thy strength.
2 Hear my prayer, O God, * and harken unto the words of my mouth.
3 For strangers are risen up against me; * and tyrants, which have not God before their eyes, seek after my
soul.
4 Behold, God is my helper; * the Lord is with them that uphold my soul.
5 He shall reward evil unto mine enemies: * destroy thou them in thy truth.
6 An offering of a free heart will I give thee, and praise thy Name, O LORD; * because it is so comfortable.
7 For he hath delivered me out of all my trouble; * and mine eye hath seen his desire upon mine enemies.
8 Glory be to the Father, and tó the Són, * and to the Hóly Ghóst;
9 As it was in the beginning, † is now, and éver sháll be, * world wíthout énd.
 Amen.
Psalm 55. Exaudi, Deus.
HEAR my prayer, O God, * and hide not thyself from my petition.
2 Take heed unto me, and hear me, * how I mourn in my prayer, and am vexed;
3 The enemy crieth so, and the ungodly cometh on so fast; * for they are minded to do me some mischief,
so maliciously are they set against me.
4 My heart is disquieted within me, * and the fear of death is fallen upon me.
5 Fearfulness and trembling are come upon me, * and an horrible dread hath overwhelmed me.
6 And I said, O that I had wings like a dove! * for then would I flee away, and be at rest.
7 Lo, then would I get me away far off, * and remain in the wilderness.
8 I would make haste to escape, * because of the stormy wind and tempest.
9 Destroy their tongues, O Lord, and divide them; * for I have spied unrighteousness and strife in the city.
10 Day and night they go about within the walls thereof: * mischief also and sorrow are in the midst of it.
11 Wickedness is therein; * deceit and guile go not out of her streets.
12 For it is not an open enemy that hath done me this dishonor; * for then I could have borne it;
13 Neither was it mine adversary that did magnify himself against me; * for then peradventure I would
have hid myself from him;
14 But it was even thou, my companion, * my guide, and mine own familiar friend.
15 We took sweet counsel together, * and walked in the house of God as friends.
16 Let death come hastily upon them, and let them go down alive into the pit; * for wickedness is in their
dwellings, and among them.
17 As for me, I will call upon God, * and the LORD shall save me.
18 In the evening, and morning, and at noonday will I pray, and that instantly; * and he shall hear my voice.
19 It is he that hath delivered my soul in peace from the battle that was against me; * for there were many
that strove with me.
20 Yea, even God, that endureth forever, shall hear me, and bring them down; * for they will not turn, nor
fear God. 
21 He laid his hands upon such as be at peace with him, * and he brake his covenant.
22 The words of his mouth were softer than butter, having war in his heart; * his words were smoother than
oil, and yet be they very swords.
23 O cast thy burden upon the LORD, and he shall nourish thee, * and shall not suffer the righteous to fall
forever.
24 And as for them, * thou, O God, shalt bring them into the pit of destruction.
25 The bloodthirsty and deceitful men shall not live out half their days: * nevertheless, my trust shall be in
thee, O Lord.
26 Glory be to the Father, and tó the Són, * and to the Hóly Ghóst;
27 As it was in the beginning, † is now, and éver sháll be, * world wíthout énd.
 Amen.
THE ELEVENTH DAY
Morning Prayer.
Psalm 56. Miserere mei, Deus.
O BE merciful unto me, O God, for man goeth about to devour me; * he is daily fighting, and troubling me.
2 Mine enemies are daily at hand to swallow me up; * for they be many that fight against me, O thou Most
Highest.
3 Nevertheless, though I am sometime afraid, * yet put I my trust in thee.
4 I will praise God, because of his word: * I have put my trust in God, and will not fear what flesh can do
unto me.
5 They daily mistake my words; * all that they imagine is to do me evil.
6 They hold all together, and keep themselves close, * and mark my steps, when they lay wait for my soul.
7 Shall they escape for their wickedness? * thou, O God, in thy displeasure shalt cast them down.
8 Thou tellest my wanderings; put my tears into thy bottle: * are not these things noted in thy book?
9 Whensoever I call upon thee, then shall mine enemies be put to flight: * this I know; for God is on my
side.
10 In God’s word will I rejoice; * in the LORD’s word will I comfort me.
11 Yea, in God have I put my trust; * I will not be afraid what man can do unto me.
12 Unto thee, O God, will I pay my vows; * unto thee will I give thanks.
13 For thou hast delivered my soul from death, and my feet from falling, * that I may walk before God in
the light of the living.
14 Glory be to the Father, and tó the Són, * and to the Hóly Ghóst;
15 As it was in the beginning, † is now, and éver sháll be, * world wíthout énd.
 Amen.
Psalm 57. Miserere mei, Deus.
BE merciful unto me, O God, be merciful unto me; for my soul trústeth in thée; * and under the shadow of
thy wings shall be my refuge, until this týranny be overpást.
2 I will call unto the Móst High Gód, * even unto the God that shall perform the cause which I háve in hánd.
3 He shall sénd from héaven, * and save me from the reproof of him that would éat me úp.
4 God shall send forth his mércy and trúth: * my sóul is among líons;
5 And I lie even among the children of men, that are sét on fíre, * whose teeth are spears and arrows, and
their tóngue a sharp swórd.
6 Set up thyself, O God, abóve the héavens; * and thy glory abóve all the éarth.
7 They have laid a net for my feet, and pressed dówn my sóul; * they have digged a pit before me, and are
fallen into the mídst of it themsélves.
8 My heart is fixed, O God, my héart is fíxed; * I will síng and give práise.
9 Awake up, my glory; awake, lúte and hárp: * I myself will awáke right éarly.
10 I will give thanks unto thee, O Lord, amóng the péoples; * and I will sing unto thee amóng the nátions.
11 For the greatness of thy mercy réacheth unto the héavens, * and thy trúth unto the clóuds.
12 Set up thyself, O God, abóve the héavens; * and thy glory above áll the éarth.
13 Glory be to the Father, and tó the Són, * and to the Hóly Ghóst;
14 As it was in the beginning, † is now, and éver sháll be, * world wíthout énd.
 Amen. 
Psalm 58. Si vere utique.
ARE your minds set upon righteousness, O ye cóngregátion? * and do ye judge the thing that is right, O ye
sóns of mén?
2 Yea, ye imagine mischief in your heart upón the éarth, * and your hands déal with wíckedness.
3 The ungodly are froward, even from their móther’s wómb; * as soon as they are born, they go astráy, and
speak líes.
4 They are as venomous as the póison of a sérpent, * even like the deaf adder, that stóppeth her éars;
5 Which refuseth to hear the vóice of the chármer, * charm he néver so wísely.
6 Break their teeth, O Gód, in their móuths; * smite the jawbones of the líons, O LÓRD.
7 Let them fall away like water that rúnneth ápace; * when they shoot their arrows, let them be róoted óut.
8 Let them consume away like a snail, and be like the untimely frúit of a wóman; * and let them not sée the
sún.
9 Or ever your pots be made hót with thórns, * he shall take them away with a whirlwind, the green and the
búrning alíke.
10 The righteous shall rejoice when he séeth the véngeance; * he shall wash his footsteps in the blóod of
the ungódly.
11 So that a man shall say, Verily there is a rewárd for the ríghteous; * doubtless there is a God that júdgeth
the éarth.
12 Glory be to the Father, and tó the Són, * and to the Hóly Ghóst;
13 As it was in the beginning, † is now, and éver sháll be, * world wíthout énd.
 Amen.
Evening Prayer
Psalm 59. Eripe me de inimicis.
DELIVER me from mine énemies, O Gód; * defend me from them that ríse up agáinst me.
2 O deliver me from the wícked dóers, * and save me from the blóodthirsty mén.
3 For lo, they lie wáiting for my sóul; * the mighty men are gathered against me, without any offence or
fault of mé, O LÓRD.
4 They run and prepare themselves withóut my fáult; * arise thou therefore to hélp me, and béhold.
5 Stand up, O LORD God of hosts, thou God of Israel, to visit áll the héathen, * and be not merciful unto
them that offend of málicious wíckedness.
6 They go to and fró in the évening, * they grin like a dog, and run about thróugh the cíty.
7 Behold, they speak with their mouth, and swords are ín their líps; * for whó doth héar?
8 But thou, O LORD, shalt háve them in derísion, * and thou shalt laugh all the héathen to scórn.
9 My strength will I áscribe unto thée; * for thou art the Gód of my réfuge.
10 God showeth me his góodness plénteously; * and God shall let me see my désire upon mine énemies.
11 Slay them not, lest my péople forgét it; * but scatter them abroad among the people, and put them down,
O Lórd our defénse.
12 For the sin of their mouth, and for the words of their lips, they shall be táken in their príde: * and why?
their talk is of cúrsing and líes.
13 Consume them in thy wrath, consume them, that théy may pérish; * and know that it is God that ruleth
in Jacob, and unto the énds of the wórld.
14 And in the évening they will retúrn, * grin like a dog, and will gó about the cíty.
15 They will run here and thére for méat, * and grudge if they bé not sátisfied.
16 As for me, I will sing of thy power, and will praise thy mercy betímes in the mórning; * for thou hast
been my defense and refuge in the dáy of my tróuble.
17 Unto thee, O my stréngth, will I síng; * for thou, O God, art my refuge, and my mérciful Gód.
18 Glory be to the Father, and tó the Són, * and to the Hóly Ghóst;
19 As it was in the beginning, † is now, and éver sháll be, * world wíthout énd.
 Amen. 
Psalm 60. Deus, repulisti nos.
O GOD, thou hast cast us out, and scáttered us abróad; * thou hast also been displeased: O túrn thee unto us
agáin.
2 Thou hast moved the lánd, and divíded it: * heal the sores thereóf, for it sháketh.
3 Thou hast showed thy people héavy thíngs; * thou hast given us a drink of déadly wíne.
4 Thou hast given a token for súch as féar thee, * that they may triumph bécause of the trúth.
5 Therefore were thy belóved delívered; * help me with thy right hánd, and héar me.
6 God hath spoken in his holiness, I will rejoice, and divíde Shéchem, * and mete out the válley of Súccoth.
7 Gilead is mine, and Manásseh is míne; * Ephraim also is the strength of my head; Júdah is my láwgiver;
8 Moab is my wash-pot; over Edom will I cást out my shóe; * Philistia, bé thou glád of me.
9 Who will léad me into the strong cíty? * who will bríng me into Édom?
10 Hast not thou cast us óut, O Gód? * wilt not thou, O God, go óut with our hósts?
11 O be thou our hélp in tróuble; * for vain is the hélp of mán.
12 Through God will we dó great ácts; * for it is he that shall tréad down our énemies.
13 Glory be to the Father, and tó the Són, * and to the Hóly Ghóst;
14 As it was in the beginning, † is now, and éver sháll be, * world wíthout énd.
 Amen.
Psalm 61. Exaudi, Deus.
HEAR my crýing, O Gód, * give ear únto my práyer.
2 From the ends of the earth will I cáll upon thée, * when my héart is in héaviness.
3 O set me up upon the rock that is hígher than Í; * for thou hast been my hope, and a strong tower for me
agáinst the énemy.
4 I will dwell in thy tábernacle foréver, * and my trust shall be under the cóvering of thy wíngs.
5 For thou, O Lord, hast héard my desíres, * and hast given an heritage unto those that féar thy Náme.
6 Thou shalt grant the Kíng a long lífe, * that his years may endure throughout áll generátions.
7 He shall dwell before Gód foréver: * O prepare thy loving mercy and faithfulness, that théy may préserve
him.
8 So will I alway sing práise unto thy Náme, * that I máy daily perfórm my vóws.
9 Glory be to the Father, and tó the Són, * and to the Hóly Ghóst;

THE TWELFTH DAY
Morning Prayer
Psalm 62. Nonne Deo?
MY soul truly waiteth stíll upon Gód; * for of him cómeth my salvátion.
2 He verily is my stréngth and my salvátion; * he is my defense, so that I shall nót greatly fáll.
3 How long will ye imagine mischief against évery mán? * Ye shall be slain all the sort of you; yea, as a
tottering wall shall ye be, and like a bróken hédge.
4 Their device is only how to put him out whom Gód will exált; * their delight is in lies; they give good
words with their mouth, but cúrse with their héart.
5 Nevertheless, my soul, wait thou stíll upon Gód; * for my hópe is in hím.
6 He truly is my stréngth and my salvátion; * he is my defense, so that I sháll not fáll.
7 In God is my héalth and my glóry; * the rock of my might; and in Gód is my trúst.
8 O put your trust in him álway, ye péople; * pour out your hearts before him, for Gód is our hópe.
9 As for the children of men, they are but vanity; the children of mén are decéitful; * upon the weights they
are altogether lighter than vánity itsélf.
10 O trust not in wrong and robbery; give not yoursélves unto vánity: * if riches increase, set not your héart
upón them.
11 God spake once, and twice I have also héard the sáme, * that power belóngeth unto Gód; 
12 And that thou, Lord, árt mérciful; * for thou rewardest every man accórding to his wórk.
13 Glory be to the Father, and tó the Són, * and to the Hóly Ghóst;
14 As it was in the beginning, † is now, and éver sháll be, * world wíthout énd.
 Amen.
Psalm 63. Deus, Deus meus.
O GOD, thou árt my Gód; * éarly will I séek thee.
2 My soul thirsteth for thee, my flesh also lóngeth after thée, * in a barren and dry land where no wáter ís.
3 Thus have I looked for thee ín the sánctuary, * that I might behold thy pówer and glóry.
4 For thy loving-kindness is better than the lífe itsélf: * my líps shall práise thee.
5 As long as I live will I magnify thee ín this mánner, * and lift up my hánds in thy Náme.
6 My soul shall be satisfied, even as it were with márrow and fátness, * when my mouth praiseth thee with
jóyful líps.
7 Have I not remémbered thee in my béd, * and thought upon thee when Í was wáking?
8 Because thou hast béen my hélper; * therefore under the shadow of thy wings will Í rejóice.
9 My soul hángeth upón thee; * thy right hand háth uphólden me.
10 These also that seek the húrt of my sóul, * they shall go únder the éarth.
11 Let them fall upon the édge of the swórd, * that they may be a pórtion for fóxes.
12 But the King shall rejoice in God; all they also that swear by him shall bé comménded; * for the mouth
of them that speak líes shall be stópped.
13 Glory be to the Father, and tó the Són, * and to the Hóly Ghóst;
14 As it was in the beginning, † is now, and éver sháll be, * world wíthout énd.
 Amen.
Psalm 64. Exaudi, Deus.
HEAR my voice, O Gód, in my práyer; * preserve my life from féar of the énemy.
2 Hide me from the gathering tógether of the fróward, * and from the insurrection of wícked dóers;
3 Who have whet their tóngue like a swórd, * and shoot out their arrows, even bítter wórds;
4 That they may privily shoot at hím that is pérfect: * suddenly do they hít him, and fear nót.
5 They encourage themsélves in míschief, * and commune among themselves, how they may lay snares;
and say, that no mán shall sée them.
6 They imagine wíckedness, and práctise it; * that they keep secret among themselves, every man in the
déep of his héart.
7 But God shall suddenly shóot at them with a swift árrow, * that théy shall be wóunded.
8 Yea, their own tongues shall máke them fáll; * insomuch that whoso seeth them shall láugh them to scórn.
9 And all men that see it shall say, Thís hath God dóne; * for they shall perceive that ít is his wórk.
10 The righteous shall rejoice in the LORD, and put his trúst in hím; * and all they that are true of héart shall
be glád.
11 Glory be to the Father, and tó the Són, * and to the Hóly Ghóst;
12 As it was in the beginning, † is now, and éver sháll be, * world wíthout énd.
 Amen.

THOU, O God, art práised in Síon; * and unto thee shall the vow be perfórmed in Jerúsalem.
2 Thou that héarest the práyer, * unto thee shall áll flesh cóme.
3 My misdeeds preváil agáinst me: * O be thou mérciful unto our síns.
4 Blessed is the man whom thou choosest, and recéivest unto thée: * he shall dwell in thy court, and shall
be satisfied with the pleasures of thy house, even of thy hóly témple.
5 Thou shalt show us wonderful things in thy righteousness, O Gód of our salvátion; * thou that art the
hope of all the ends of the earth, and of them that remáin in the broad séa.
6 Who in his strength setteth fást the móuntains, * and is girded abóut with pówer. 
7 Who stilleth the ráging of the séa, * and the noise of his waves, and the mádness of the péoples.
8 They also that dwell in the uttermost parts of the earth shall be afráid at thy tókens, * thou that makest the
outgoings of the morning and évening to práise thee.
9 Thou visitest the éarth, and bléssest it; * thou makest it véry plénteous.
10 The river of God is fúll of wáter: * thou preparest their corn, for so thou provídest for the éarth.
11 Thou waterest her furrows; thou sendest rain into the little válleys theréof; * thou makest it soft with the
drops of rain, and blessest the íncrease óf it.
12 Thou crownest the yéar with thy góodness; * and thy clóuds drop fátness.
13 They shall drop upon the dwéllings of the wílderness; * and the little hills shall rejoice on évery síde.
14 The folds shall be fúll of shéep; * the valleys also shall stand so thick with corn, that they shall láugh
and síng.
15 Glory be to the Father, and tó the Són, * and to the Hóly Ghóst;
16 As it was in the beginning, † is now, and éver sháll be, * world wíthout énd.

Psalm 66. Jubilate Deo.
O BE joyful in God, áll ye lánds; * sing praises unto the honor of his Name; make his práise to be glórious.
2 Say unto God, O how wonderful art thóu in thy wórks! * through the greatness of thy power shall thine
enemies bow dówn unto thée.
3 For all the world shall wórship thée, * sing of thee, and práise thy Náme.
4 O come hither, and behold the wórks of Gód; * how wonderful he is in his doing toward the chíldren of
mén.
5 He turned the séa into dry lánd, * so that they went through the water on foot; there did we rejóice thereóf.
6 He ruleth with his power forever; his eyes behóld the nátions: * and such as will not believe shall not be
able to exált themsélves.
7 O praise our Gód, ye péoples, * and make the voice of his práise to be héard;
8 Who holdeth our sóul in lífe; * and suffereth not our féet to slíp.
9 For thou, O Gód, hast próved us; * thou also hast tried us, like as sílver is tríed.
10 Thou broughtest us ínto the snáre; * and laidest trouble upón our lóins.
11 Thou sufferedst men to ride óver our héads; * we went through fire and water, and thou broughtest us
out into a wéalthy pláce.
12 I will go into thine house with burnt-offerings, and will páy thee my vóws, * which I promised with my
lips, and spake with my mouth, when Í was in tróuble.
13 I will offer unto thee fat burnt-sacrifices, with the íncense of ráms; * I will offer búllocks and góats.
14 O come hither, and harken, all yé that fear Gód; * and I will tell you what he hath dóne for my sóul.
15 I called unto hím with my móuth, * and gave him práises with my tóngue.
16 If I incline unto wíckedness with mine héart, * the Lórd will not héar me.
17 But Gód hath héard me; * and considered the vóice of my práyer.
18 Praised be God, who hath not cast óut my práyer, * nor turned his mércy from mé.
19 Glory be to the Father, and tó the Són, * and to the Hóly Ghóst;
20 As it was in the beginning, † is now, and éver sháll be, * world wíthout énd.

THE THIRTEENTH DAY
Morning Prayer
Psalm 68. Exsurgat Deus.
LET God arise, and let his énemies be scáttered; * let them also that hate him flée befóre him.
2 Like as the smoke vanisheth, so shalt thou dríve them awáy; * and like as wax melteth at the fire, so let
the ungodly perish at the présence of Gód.
3 But let the righteous be glad, and rejóice before Gód; * let them also be mérry and jóyful.
4 O sing unto God, and sing praises unto his Name; magnify him that rídeth upon the héavens; * praise him
in his Name JAH, and rejóice befóre him.
5 He is a Father of the fatherless, and defendeth the cáuse of the wídows; * even God in his hóly habitátion.
6 He is the God that maketh men to be of one mind in an house, and bringeth the prísoners out of captívity;
* but letteth the runagates contínue in scárceness.
7 O God, when thou wentest forth befóre the péople; * when thou wentest thróugh the wílderness,
8 The earth shook, and the heavens dropped at the présence of Gód; * even as Sinai also was moved at the
presence of God, who is the Gód of Ísrael.
9 Thou, O God, sentest a gracious rain upon thíne inhéritance, * and refreshedst it when ít was wéary.
10 Thy congregation shall dwéll theréin; * for thou, O God, hast of thy goodness prepáred for the póor.
11 The Lórd gave the wórd; * great was the company of women that báre the tídings.
12 Kings with their armies did flee, and wére discómfited, * and they of the household divíded the spóil.
13 Though ye have lain among the sheep-folds, yet shall ye be as the wíngs of a dóve * that is covered with
silver wings, and her féathers like góld.
14 When the Almighty scattered kíngs for their sáke, * then were they as white as snáw in Sálmon.
15 As the hill of Bashan, só is Gód’s híll; * even an high hill, as the híll of Báshan.
16 Why mock ye so, ye high hills? this is God’s hill, in the which it pléaseth him to dwéll; * yea,
the LORD will abide in ít foréver.
17 The chariots of God are twenty thousand, even thóusands of ángels; * and the Lord is among them as in
the holy pláce of Sínai.
18 Thou art gone up on high, thou hast led captivity captive, and received gífts from mén; * yea, even from
thine enemies, that the LORD God might dwéll amóng them.
19 Práised be the Lord dáily, * even the God who helpeth us, and poureth his bénefits upón us.
20 He is our God, even the God of whom cómeth salvátion: * GOD is the Lord, by whóm we escape déath.
21 God shall wound the héad of his énemies, * and the hairy scalp of such a one as goeth on stíll in his
wíckedness.
22 The Lord hath said, I will bring my people again, as I díd from Báshan; * mine own will I bring again,
as I did sometime from the déep of the séa.
23 That thy foot may be dipped in the blóod of thine énemies, * and that the tongue of thy dogs may be réd
through the sáme.
24 It is well seen, O God, hów thou góest; * how thou, my God and King, góest in the sánctuary.
25 The singers go before, the mínstrels follow áfter, * in the midst of the damsels pláying with the tímbrels.
26 Give thanks unto God the Lórd in the congregátion, * ye that are of the fóuntain of Ísrael.
27 There is little Benjamin their ruler, and the princes of Júdah their cóuncil; * the princes of Zebulon, and
the prínces of Naphtháli.
28 Thy God hath sent forth stréngth for thée; * stablish the thing, O God, that thou hast wróught in ús,
29 For thy temple’s sáke at Jerúsalem; * so shall kings bring présents unto thée.
30 Rebuke thou the dragon and the bull, with the leaders of the heathen, so that they humbly bring píeces of
sílver; * scatter thou the peoples that delíght in wár; 
31 Then shall the princes come óut of Égypt; * the Morians’ land shall soon stretch out her hánds unto Gód.
32 Sing unto God, O ye kíngdoms of the éarth; * O sing praises únto the Lórd;
33 Who sitteth in the heavens over all, fróm the begínning: * lo, he doth send out his voice; yea, and that a
míghty vóice.
34 Ascribe ye the power to Gód over Ísrael; * his worship and strength is ín the clóuds.
35 O God, wonderful art thou in thy hóly pláces: * even the God of Israel, he will give strength and power
unto his people. Bléssed be Gód.
36 Glory be to the Father, and tó the Són, * and to the Hóly Ghóst;
37 As it was in the beginning, † is now, and éver sháll be, * world wíthout énd.
 Amen.
Evening Prayer
Psalm 69. Salvum me fac.
SÁVE me, O Gód; * for the waters are come in, even únto my sóul.
2 I stick fast in the deep míre, where no gróund is; * I am come into deep waters, so that the flóods run óver
me.
3 I am weary of crying; my thróat is drý; * my sight faileth me for waiting so long upón my Gód.
4 They that hate me without a cause are more than the háirs of my héad; * they that are mine enemies, and
would destroy me gúiltless, are míghty.
5 I paid them the things that I néver tóok: * God, thou knowest my simpleness, and my faults are not híd
from thée.
6 Let not them that trust in thee, O Lord GOD of hosts, be ashámed for my cáuse; * let not those that seek
thee be confounded through me, O Lord Gód of Ísrael.
7 And why? for thy sake have I súffered repróof; * shame hath cóvered my fáce.
8 I am become a stranger únto my bréthren, * even an alien unto my móther’s chíldren.
9 For the zeal of thine house hath éven éaten me; * and the rebukes of them that rebuked thee are fállen
upón me.
10 I wept, and chastened mysélf with fásting, * and that was túrned to my repróof.
11 I put on sáckcloth also, * and they jésted upón me.
12 They that sit in the gate spéak agáinst me, * and the drunkards make sóngs upón me.
13 But, LORD, I make my práyer unto thée * in an accéptable tíme.
14 Hear me, O God, in the múltitude of thy mércy, * even in the trúth of thy salvátion.
15 Take me out of the míre, that I sínk not; * O let me be delivered from them that hate me, and óut of the
deep wáters.
16 Let not the waterflood drown me, neither let the deep swállow me úp; * and let not the pit shut her
móuth upón me.
17 Hear me, O LORD, for thy loving-kíndness is cómfortable; * turn thee unto me according to the
múltitude of thy mércies.
18 And hide not thy face from thy servant; for Í am in tróuble: * O háste thee, and héar me.
19 Draw nigh unto my sóul, and sáve it; * O deliver me, becáuse of mine énemies.
20 Thou hast known my reproach, my sháme, and my díshonor: * mine adversaries are áll in thy síght.
21 Reproach hath broken my heart; I am fúll of héaviness: * I looked for some to have pity on me, but there
was no man, neither found I ány to cómfort me.
22 They gave me gáll to éat; * and when I was thirsty they gave me vínegar to drínk.
23 Let their table be made a snare to take themsélves withál; * and let the things that should have been for
their wealth be unto them an occásion of fálling.
24 Let their eyes be blinded, thát they see nót; * and ever bow thou dówn their bácks.
25 Pour out thine indignátion upón them, * and let thy wrathful displéasure take hóld of them.
26 Let their habitátion be vóid, * and no man to dwéll in their ténts.
27 For they persecute him whom thóu hast smítten; * and they talk how they may vex them whom thóu
hast wóunded. 
28 Let them fall from one wíckedness to anóther, * and not come ínto thy ríghteousness.
29 Let them be wiped out of the bóok of the líving, * and not be wrítten among the ríghteous.
30 As for me, when I am póor and in héaviness, * thy help, O God, shall líft me úp.
31 I will praise the Name of Gód with a sóng, * and magnify it wíth thanksgíving.
32 This also shall pléase the LÓRD * better than a bullock that hath hórns and hóofs.
33 The humble shall consider thís, and be glád: * seek ye after God, and your sóul shall líve.
34 For the LORD héareth the póor, * and despiseth nót his prísoners.
35 Let heaven and éarth práise him: * the sea, and all that móveth thérein.
36 For God will save Sion, and build the cíties of Júdah, * that men may dwell there, and have it ín
posséssion.
37 The posterity also of his servants sháll inhérit it; * and they that love his Name shall dwéll theréin.
38 Glory be to the Father, and tó the Són, * and to the Hóly Ghóst;
39 As it was in the beginning, † is now, and éver sháll be, * world wíthout énd.
 Amen.
Psalm 70. Deus, in adjutorium.
HASTE thee, O Gód, to delíver me; * make haste to hélp me, O LÓRD.
2 Let them be ashamed and confounded that seek áfter my sóul; * let them be turned backward and put to
confusion that wísh me évil.
3 Let them for their reward be soon bróught to sháme, * that crý over me, Thére! there!
4 But let all those that seek thee be joyful and glád in thée: * and let all such as delight in thy salvation say
alway, The Lórd be práised.
5 As for me, I am póor and in mísery: * haste thee unto mé, O Gód.
6 Thou art my hélper, and my redéemer: * O LORD, máke no long tárrying.
7 Glory be to the Father, and tó the Són, * and to the Hóly Ghóst;
8 As it was in the beginning, † is now, and éver sháll be, * world wíthout énd.
 Amen.
THE FOURTEENTH DAY
Morning Prayer
Psalm 71. In te, Domine, speravi.
IN thee, O LORD, have I put my trust; let me never be pút to confúsion, * but rid me and deliver me in thy
righteousness; incline thine ear unto mé, and sáve me.
2 Be thou my stronghold, whereunto I may álway resórt: * thou hast promised to help me, for thou art my
house of defénse, and my cástle.
3 Deliver me, O my God, out of the hánd of the ungódly, * out of the hand of the unríghteous and crúel
man.
4 For thou, O Lord GOD, art the thíng that I lóng for: * thou art my hope, éven from my yóuth.
5 Through thee have I been holden up ever sínce I was bórn: * thou art he that took me out of my mother’s
womb: my praise shall be álway of thée.
6 I am become as it were a mónster unto mány, * but my sure trúst is in thée.
7 O let my mouth be fílled with thy práise, * that I may sing of thy glory and honor áll the day lóng.
8 Cast me not away in the tíme of áge; * forsake me not when my strength fáileth mé.
9 For mine enemies spéak agáinst me; * and they that lay wait for my soul take their counsel togéther,
sáying,
10 Gód hath forsáken him; * persecute him, and take him, for there is nóne to delíver him.
11 Go not far from mé, O Gód; * my God, háste thee to hélp me.
12 Let them be confounded and perish that are agáinst my sóul; * let them be covered with shame and
dishonor that seek to dó me évil.
13 As for me, I will patiently abíde alwáy, * and will praise thee móre and móre. 
14 My mouth shall daily speak of thy ríghteousness and salvátion; * for I know no énd thereóf.
15 I will go forth in the stréngth of the Lord GÓD, * and will make mention of thy ríghteousness ónly.
16 Thou, O God, hast taught me from my youth úp until nów; * therefore will I tell of thy wóndrous wórks.
17 Forsake me not, O God, in mine old age, when Í am gray-héaded, * until I have showed thy strength
unto this generation, and thy power to all them that are yét for to cóme.
18 Thy righteousness, O God, is véry hígh, * and great things are they that thou hast done: O God, who is
líke unto thée!
19 O what great troubles and adversities hast thou showed me! and yet didst thou túrn and refrésh me; *
yea, and broughtest me from the deep of the éarth agáin.
20 Thou hast bróught me to great hónor, * and comforted me on évery síde:
21 Therefore will I praise thee, and thy faithfulness, O God, playing upon an ínstrument of músic: * unto
thee will I sing upon the harp, O thou Hóly One of Ísrael.
22 My lips will be glad when I sing unto thée; * and so will my soul whom thóu hast delívered.
23 My tongue also shall talk of thy righteousness áll the day lóng; * for they are confounded and brought
unto shame that seek to dó me évil.
24 Glory be to the Father, and tó the Són, * and to the Hóly Ghóst;
25 As it was in the beginning, † is now, and éver sháll be, * world wíthout énd.
 Amen.
Psalm 72. Deus, judicium.
GIVE the King thy júdgments, O Gód, * and thy righteousness únto the King’s són.
2 Then shall he judge thy people accórding unto ríght, * and defénd the póor.
3 The mountains also sháll bring péace, * and the little hills righteousness únto the péople.
4 He shall keep the simple fólk by their ríght, * defend the children of the poor, and púnish the wróng doer.
5 They shall fear thee, as long as the sun and móon endúreth, * from one generátion to anóther.
6 He shall come down like the rain upón the mown gráss, * even as the drops that wáter the éarth.
7 In his time shall the réghteous flóurish; * yea, and abundance of peace, so long as the móon endúreth.
8 His dominion shall be also from the one séa to the óther, * and from the River únto the world’s énd.
9 They that dwell in the wilderness shall knéel befóre him; * his enemies shall líck the dúst.
10 The kings of Tarshish and of the ísles shall give présents; * the kings of Arabia and Sába shall bring
gífts.
11 All kings shall fáll down befóre him; * all nations shall dó him sérvice.
12 For he shall deliver the póor when he críeth; * the needy also, and him that háth no hélper.
13 He shall be favorable to the símple and néedy, * and shall preserve the sóuls of the póor.
14 He shall deliver their souls from fálsehood and wróng; * and dear shall their blóod be in his síght.
15 He shall live, and unto him shall be given of the góld of Arábia; * prayer shall be made ever unto him,
and daily shall hé be práised.
16 There shall be an heap of corn in the earth, high upon the hills ; the fruit thereof shall sháke like
Lébanon: * and they of the city shall flourish like gráss upon the éarth.
17 His Name shall endure forever; his Name shall remain under the sun among the posterities, which shall
be bléssed in hím; * and all the nátions shall práise him.
18 Blessed be the LORD God, even the Gód of Ísrael, * which only doeth wóndrous thíngs;
19 And blessed be the Name of his májesty foréver: * and all the earth shall be fílled with his májesty.
Amen, Amen.
20 Glory be to the Father, and tó the Són, * and to the Hóly Ghóst;
21 As it was in the beginning, † is now, and éver sháll be, * world wíthout énd.
 Amen.
BOOK III
Evening Prayer
Psalm 73. Quam bonus Israel!
TRULY God is lóving unto Ísrael: * even unto such as are óf a clean héart. 
2 Nevertheless, my feet were álmost góne, * my treadings had wéll-nigh slípped.
3 And why? I was gríeved at the wícked: * I do also see the ungódly in such prospérity.
4 For they are in no péril of déath; * but are lústy and stróng.
5 They come in no misfortune like óther fólk; * neither are they plagued like óther mén.
6 And this is the cause that they are so hólden with príde, * and cruelty covereth them ás a gárment.
7 Their eyes swéll with fátness, * and they do éven what they lúst.
8 They corrupt other, and speak of wícked blásphemy; * their talking is agáinst the Most Hígh.
9 For they stretch forth their mouth únto the héaven, * and their tongue goeth thróugh the wórld.
10 Therefore fall the people únto thém, * and thereout suck they no smáll advántage.
11 Tush, say they, how should Gód percéive it? * is there knówledge in the Most Hígh?
12 Lo, thése are the ungódly, * these prosper in the world, and these have ríches in posséssion:
13 And I said, Then have I cleansed my héart in váin, * and washed my hánds in ínnocency.
14 All the day long have Í been púnished, * and chastened évery mórning.
15 Yea, and I had almost said éven as théy; * but lo, then I should have condemned the generátion of thy
chíldren.
16 Then thought Í to understánd this; * but ít was too hárd for me,
17 Until I went into the sánctuary of Gód: * then understood I the énd of these mén;
18 Namely, how thou dost set them in slíppery pláces, * and castest them down, and destróyest thém.
19 O how súddenly do they consúme, * perish, and cóme to a féarful end!
20 Yea, even like as a dream when óne awáketh; * so shalt thou make their image to vanish óut of the cíty.
21 Thus my héart was gríeved, * and it went even thróugh my réins.
22 So foolish was Í, and ígnorant, * even as it were a béast befóre thee.
23 Nevertheless, I am álway bý thee; * for thou hast hólden me by my ríght hand.
24 Thou shalt gúide me with thy cóunsel, * and after that recéive me with glóry.
25 Whom have I in héaven but thée? * and there is none upon earth that I desire in compárison of thée.
26 My flésh and my heart fáileth; * but God is the strength of my heart, and my pórtion foréver.
27 For lo, they that forsáke thee shall pérish; * thou hast destroyed all them that are unfáithful unto thée.
28 But it is good for me to hold me fast by God, to put my trúst in the Lord GÓD, * and to speak of all thy
works in the gates of the dáughter of Síon.
29 Glory be to the Father, and tó the Són, * and to the Hóly Ghóst;
30 As it was in the beginning, † is now, and éver sháll be, * world wíthout énd.
 Amen.
Psalm 74. Ut quid, Deus?
O GOD, wherefore art thou absent from ús so lóng? * why is thy wrath so hot against the shéep of thy
pásture?
2 O think upon thy cóngregátion, * whom thou hast purchased, and redéemed of óld.
3 Think upon the tribe of thíne inhéritance, * and Mount Sion, wherein thóu hast dwélt.
4 Lift up thy feet, that thou mayest utterly destroy évery énemy, * which hath done évil in thy sánctuary.
5 Thine adversaries roar in the midst of thy cóngregátions, * and set up their bánners for tókens.
6 He that hewed timber afore óut of the thick trées, * was known to bring it to an éxcellent wórk.
7 But now they break down all the carved wórk thereóf * with áxes and hámmers.
8 They have set fire upon thy hóly pláces, * and have defiled the dwelling-place of thy Name, even únto the
gróund.
9 Yea, they said in their hearts, Let us make havoc of them áltogéther: * thus have they burnt up all the
houses of Gód in the lánd.
10 We see not our tokens; there is not one próphet móre; * no, not one is there among us, that
understandeth ány móre.
11 O God, how long shall the adversary dó this dishónor? * shall the enemy blaspheme thy Náme foréver?
12 Why withdrawest thóu thy hánd? * why pluckest thou not thy right hand out of thy bosom to consúme
the énemy? 
13 For God is my Kíng of óld; * the help that is done upon earth, he dóeth it himsélf.
14 Thou didst divide the sea thróugh thy pówer; * thou brakest the heads of the drágons in the wáters.
15 Thou smotest the heads of levíathan in píeces, * and gavest him to be meat for the péople of the
wílderness.
16 Thou broughtest out fountains and waters óut of the hard rócks; * thou driedst up míghty wáters.
17 The day is thine, and the níght is thíne; * thou hast prepared the líght and the sún.
18 Thou hast set all the borders óf the éarth; * thou hast made súmmer and wínter.
19 Remember this, O LORD, how the énemy hath rebúked; * and how the foolish people hath blásphemed
thy Náme.
20 O deliver not the soul of thy turtledove unto the múltitude of the énemies; * and forget not the
congregation of the póor foréver.
21 Look upón the cóvenant; * for all the earth is full of darkness and crúel habitátions.
22 O let not the simple go awáy ashámed; * but let the poor and needy give praise únto thy Náme.
23 Arise, O God, maintáin thine own cáuse; * remember how the foolish man blasphémeth thee dáily.
24 Forget not the vóice of thine énemies: * the presumption of them that hate thee increaseth ever móre and
móre.
25 Glory be to the Father, and tó the Són, * and to the Hóly Ghóst;
26 As it was in the beginning, † is now, and éver sháll be, * world wíthout énd.
 Amen.
THE FIFTEENTH DAY
Morning Prayer
Psalm 75. Confitebimur tibi.
UNTO thee, O God, do wé give thánks; * yea, unto thee do wé give thánks.
2 Thy Name álso is so nígh; * and that do thy wondrous wórks decláre.
3 In the appointed time, sáith Gód, * I shall judge accórding unto ríght.
4 The earth is weak, and all the inhábiters thereóf: * I bear up the píllars of ít.
5 I said unto the fools, Deal nót so mádly; * and to the ungodly, Set not úp your hórn.
6 Set not up your hórn on hígh, * and speak not wíth a stiff néck.
7 For promotion cometh neither from the east, nor fróm the wést, * nor yét from the sóuth.
8 And why? Gód is the Júdge; * he putteth down one, and sétteth up anóther.
9 For in the hand of the LORD there is a cup, and the wíne is réd; * it is full mixed, and he poureth óut of
the sáme.
10 As for the drégs thereóf, * all the ungodly of the earth shall drink them, and súck them óut.
11 But I will talk of the Gód of Jácob, * and práise him foréver.
12 All the horns of the ungodly álso will I bréak, * and the horns of the ríghteous shall be exálted.
13 Glory be to the Father, and tó the Són, * and to the Hóly Ghóst;
14 As it was in the beginning, † is now, and éver sháll be, * world wíthout énd.
 Amen.
Psalm 76. Notus in Judaea.
IN Júdah is God knówn; * his Name is gréat in Ísrael.
2 At Sálem is his tábernacle, * and his dwélling in Síon.
3 There brake he the árrows of the bów, * the shield, the swórd, and the báttle.
4 Thou art glórious in míght, * when thou comest from the hílls of the róbbers.
5 The proud are robbed, they have slépt their sléep; * and all the men whose hands were míghty have found
nóthing.
6 At thy rebuke, O Gód of Jácob, * both the chariot and hórse are fállen.
7 Thou, even thóu art to be féared; * and who may stand in thy sight when thóu art ángry?
8 Thou didst cause thy judgment to be héard from héaven; * the earth trémbled, and was stíll, 
9 When God aróse to júdgment, * and to help all the méek upon éarth.
10 The fierceness of man shall túrn to thy práise; * and the fierceness of them shalt thóu refráin.
11 Promise unto the LORD your God, and keep it, all ye that are róund abóut him; * bring presents unto him
that óught to be féared.
12 He shall refrain the spírit of prínces, * and is wonderful among the kíngs of the éarth.
13 Glory be to the Father, and tó the Són, * and to the Hóly Ghóst;
14 As it was in the beginning, † is now, and éver sháll be, * world wíthout énd.
 Amen.
Psalm 77. Voce mea ad Dominum.
I WILL cry unto Gód with my vóice; * even unto God will I cry with my voice, and he shall hárken unto
mé.
2 In the time of my trouble I sóught the Lórd: * I stretched forth my hands unto him, and ceased not in the
night season; my sóul refused cómfort.
3 When I am in heaviness, I will thínk upon Gód; * when my heart is vexed, I wíll compláin.
4 Thou hóldest mine eyes wáking: * I am so feeble that I cánnot spéak.
5 I have considered the dáys of óld, * and the yéars that are pást.
6 I call to remémbrance my sóng, * and in the night I commune with mine own heart, and séarch out my
spírit.
7 Will the Lord absent himsélf foréver? * and will he be no móre entréated?
8 Is his mercy clean góne foréver? * and is his promise come utterly to an énd forévermore?
9 Hath God forgótten to be grácious? * and will he shut up his loving-kíndness in displéasure?
10 And I said, It is mine ówn infírmity; * but I will remember the years of the right hánd of the Most
Híghest.
11 I will remember the wórks of the LÓRD, * and call to mind thy wónders of old tíme.
12 I will think also of áll thy wórks, * and my talking shall bé of thy dóings.
13 Thy way, O Gód, is hóly: * who is so great a Gód as our Gód?
14 Thou art the God that dóest wónders, * and hast declared thy power amóng the péoples.
15 Thou hast mightily delivered thy people, * even the sons of Jacob and Joseph.
16 The waters saw thee, O God, the waters saw thee, and wére afráid; * the depths álso were tróubled.
17 The clouds poured out wáter, the air thúndered, * and thine árrows went abróad.
18 The voice of thy thunder was heard róund abóut: * the lightnings shone upon the ground; the earth was
moved, and shóok withál.
19 Thy way is in the sea, and thy páths in the great wáters, * and thy fóotsteps are not knówn.
20 Thou leddest thy péople like shéep, * by the hand of Móses and Áaron.
21 Glory be to the Father, and tó the Són, * and to the Hóly Ghóst;
22 As it was in the beginning, † is now, and éver sháll be, * world wíthout énd.
 Amen.
Evening Prayer
Psalm 78.
I. Attendite, popule.
HEAR my law, Ó my péople; * incline your ears unto the wórds of my móuth.
2 I will open my móuth in a párable; * I will declare hard séntences of óld;
3 Which we have héard and knówn, * and such as our fáthers have tóld us;
4 That we should not hide them from the children of the generátions to cóme; * but to show the honor of
the LORD, his mighty and wonderful works that hé hath dóne.
5 He made a covenant with Jacob, and gave Ísrael a láw, * which he commanded our forefathers to téach
their chíldren;
6 That their postérity might knów it, * and the children which were yét unbórn;
7 To the intent that whén they came úp, * they might show their chíldren the sáme; 
8 That they might put their trúst in Gód; * and not to forget the works of God, but to kéep his
commándments;
9 And not to be as their forefathers, a faithless and stúbborn generátion; * a generation that set not their
heart aright, and whose spirit clave not stedfástly unto Gód;
10 Like as the chíldren of Éphraim; * who being harnessed, and carrying bows, turned themselves back in
the dáy of báttle.
11 They kept not the cóvenant of Gód, * and would not wálk in his láw;
12 But forgat what hé had dóne, * and the wonderful works that he had shówed for thém.
13 Marvelous things did he in the sight of our forefathers, in the lánd of Égypt, * even in the fíeld of Zóan.
14 He divided the sea, and lét them go thróugh; * he made the waters to stánd on an héap.
15 In the daytime also he léd them with a clóud, * and all the night through with a líght of fíre.
16 He clave the hard rócks in the wílderness, * and gave them drink thereof, as it had been óut
of the great dépth.
17 He brought waters out of the stóny róck, * so that it gushed óut like the rívers.
18 Yet for all this they sinned móre agáinst him, * and provoked the Most Híghest in the wílderness.
19 They tempted Gód in their héarts, * and required méat for their lúst.
20 They spake against God álso, sáying, * Shall God prepare a táble in the wílderness?
21 He smote the stony rock indeed, that the water gushed out, and the stréams flowed withál; * but can he
give bread also, or provide flésh for his péople?
22 When the LORD heard this, hé was wróth; * so the fire was kindled in Jacob, and there came up heavy
displéasure against Ísrael;
23 Because they believed nót in Gód, * and put not their trúst in his hélp.
24 So he commanded the clóuds abóve, * and opened the dóors of héaven.
25 He rained down manna also upon them fór to éat, * and gave them fóod from héaven.
26 So man did eat ángels’ fóod; * for he sént them meat enóugh.
27 He caused the east-wind to blów under héaven; * and through his power he brought in the sóuthwest
wínd.
28 He rained flesh upon them as thíck as dúst, * and feathered fowls like as the sánd of the séa.
29 He let it fall amóng their ténts, * even round about their hábitátion.
30 So they did éat, and were well fílled; for he gave them their ówn desíre: * they were not disappóinted of
their lúst.
31 But while the meat was yet in their mouths, the heavy wrath of God came upon them, and slew the
wéalthiest of thém; * yea, and smote down the chosen men that wére in Ísrael.
32 But for all this they sínned yet móre, * and believed not his wóndrous wórks.
33 Therefore their days did he consúme in vánity, * and their yéars in tróuble.
34 When he sléw them, they sóught him, * and turned them early, and inquíred after Gód.
35 And they remembered that Gód was their stréngth, * and that the High God was théir redéemer.
36 Nevertheless, they did but flatter him with their móuth, * and dissembled with hím in their tóngue.
37 For their heart was not whóle with hím, * neither continued they stéadfast in his cóvenant.
38 But he was so merciful, that he forgáve their misdéeds, * and destróyed them nót.
39 Yea, many a time turned he his wráth awáy, * and would not suffer his whole displeasure tó aríse.
40 For he considered that théy were but flésh, * and that they were even a wind that passeth away, and
cometh nót agáin.
Glory be to the Father, and tó the Són, * and to the Hóly Ghóst;
As it was in the beginning, † is now, and éver sháll be, * world wíthout énd.
 Amen.
II. Quoties exacerbaverunt
MANY a time did they provóke him in the wílderness, * and gríeved him in the désert.
42 They turned back, and témpted Gód, * and provoked the Holy Óne in Ísrael.
43 They thought not óf his hánd, * and of the day when he delivered them from the hánd of the énemy; 
44 How he had wrought his míracles in Égypt, * and his wonders in the fíeld of Zóan.
45 He turned their wáters into blóod, * so that they might not drínk of the rívers.
46 He sent flies among them, and devóured them úp; * and frógs to destróy them.
47 He gave their fruit únto the cáterpillar, * and their labor únto the grásshopper.
48 He destroyed their vínes with háilstones, * and their mulberry trees wíth the fróst.
49 He smote their cattle álso with háilstones, * and their flócks with hot thúnderbolts.
50 He cast upon them the furiousness of his wrath, anger, displéasure, and tróuble: *and sent evil ángels
amóng them.
51 He made a way to his indignation, and spared not their sóul from déath; * but gave their life óver to the
péstilence;
52 And smote all the firstbórn in Égypt, * the most principal and mightiest in the dwéllings of Hám.
53 But as for his own people, he led them fórth like shéep, * and carried them in the wílderness like a flóck.
54 He brought them out safely, that they shóuld not féar, * and overwhelmed their énemies with the séa.
55 And brought them within the bórders of his sánctuary, * even to this mountain, which he purchased wíth
his right hánd.
56 He cast out the heathen álso befóre them, * caused their land to be divided among them for an heritage,
and made the tribes of Israel to dwéll in their ténts.
57 Yet they tempted and displeased the Móst High Gód, * and kept nót his téstimonies.
58 They turned their backs, and fell away líke their fórefathers; * starting aside like a bróken bów.
59 For they grieved him wíth their híll-altars, * and provoked him to displéasure with their ímages.
60 When God heard this, hé was wróth, * and took sore displéasure at Ísrael;
61 So that he forsook the tábernacle in Shíloh, * even the tent that he had pítched among mén.
62 He delivered their pówer into captívity, * and their beauty into the énemy’s hánd
63 He gave his people over also únto the swórd, * and was wróth with his inhéritance.
64 The fire consúmed their young mén, * and their maidens were not gíven in márriage.
65 Their priests were sláin with the swórd, * and there were no widows to máke lamentátion.
66 So the Lord awaked as one óut of sléep, * and like a giant refréshed with wíne.
67 He drave his énemies báckward, * and put them to a perpétual sháme.
68 He refused the tábernacle of Jóseph, * and chose not the tríbe of Éphraim;
69 But chose the tríbe of Júdah, * even the hill of Síon which he lóved.
70 And there he built his témple on hígh, * and laid the foundation of it like the ground which he hath
maáde contínually.
71 He chose David álso his sérvant, * and took him awáy from the shéep-folds:
72 As he was following the ewes with their yóung he tóok him, * that he might feed Jacob his people, and
Ísrael his inhéritance.
73 So he fed them with a fáithful and true héart, * and ruled them prudently with áll his pówer.
Glory be to the Father, and tó the Són, * and to the Hóly Ghóst;
As it was in the beginning, † is now, and éver sháll be, * world wíthout énd.
 Amen.
Psalm 79. Deus, venerunt.
O GOD, the heathen are come into thine inheritance; * thy holy temple have they defiled, and made
Jerusalem an heap of stones.
2 The dead bodies of thy servants have they given to be meat unto the fowls of the air, * and the flesh of
thy saints unto the beasts of the land.
3 Their blood have they shed like water on every side of Jerusalem, * and there was no man to bury them.
4 We are become an open shame to our enemies, * a very scorn and derision unto them that are round about
us.
5 LORD, how long wilt thou be angry? * shall thy jealousy burn like fire forever?
6 Pour out thine indignation upon the heathen that have not known thee; * and upon the kingdoms that have
not called upon thy Name.
7 For they have devoured Jacob, * and laid waste his dwelling place.
8 O remember not our old sins, but have mercy upon us, and that soon; * for we are come to great misery. 
9 Help us, O God of our salvation, for the glory of thy Name: * O deliver us, and be merciful unto our sins,
for thy Name’s sake.
10 Wherefore do the heathen say, * Where is now their God?
11 O let the vengeance of thy servants’ blood that is shed, * be openly showed upon the heathen, in our
sight.
12 O let the sorrowful sighing of the prisoners come before thee; * according to the greatness of thy power,
preserve thou those that are appointed to die.
13 And for the blasphemy wherewith our neighbors have blasphemed thee, * reward thou them, O Lord,
sevenfold into their bosom.
14 So we, that are thy people, and sheep of thy pasture, shall give thee thanks forever, * and will alway be
showing forth thy praise from generation to generation.
15 Glory be to the Father, and tó the Són, * and to the Hóly Ghóst;
16 As it was in the beginning, † is now, and éver sháll be, * world wíthout énd.
 Amen.
Psalm 80. Qui regis Israel.
HEAR, O thou Shepherd of Israel, thou that leadest Joseph like a flock; * show thyself also, thou that sittest
upon the Cherubim.
2 Before Ephraim, Benjamin, and Manasseh, * stir up thy strength, and come and help us.
3 Turn us again, O God; * show the light of thy countenance, and we shall be whole.
4 O LORD God of hosts, * how long wilt thou be angry with thy people that prayeth?
5 Thou feedest them with the bread of tears, * and givest them plenteousness of tears to drink.
6 Thou hast made us a very strife unto our neighbors, * and our enemies laugh us to scorn.
7 Turn us again, thou God of hosts; * show the light of thy countenance, and we shall be whole.
8 Thou hast brought a vine out of Egypt; * thou hast cast out the heathen, and planted it.
9 Thou madest room for it; * and when it had taken root, it filled the land.
10 The hills were covered with the shadow of it, * and the boughs thereof were like the goodly cedar trees.
11 She stretched out her branches unto the sea, * and her boughs unto the River.
12 Why hast thou then broken down her hedge, * that all they that go by pluck off her grapes?
13 The wild boar out of the wood doth root it up, * and the wild beasts of the field devour it.
14 Turn thee again, thou God of hosts, look down from heaven, * behold, and visit this vine;
15 And the place of the vineyard that thy right hand hath planted, * and the branch that thou madest so
strong for thyself.
16 It is burnt with fire, and cut down; * and they shall perish at the rebuke of thy countenance.
17 Let thy hand be upon the man of thy right hand, * and upon the son of man, whom thou madest so
strong for thine own self.
18 And so will not we go back from thee: * O let us live, and we shall call upon thy Name.
19 Turn us again, O LORD God of hosts; * show the light of thy countenance, and we shall be whole.
20 Glory be to the Father, and tó the Són, * and to the Hóly Ghóst;
21 As it was in the beginning, † is now, and éver sháll be, * world wíthout énd.
 Amen.
Psalm 81. Exultate Deo.
SING we merrily unto God our strength; * make a cheerful noise unto the God of Jacob.
2 Take the psalm, bring hither the tabret, * the merry harp with the lute.
3 Blow up the trumpet in the new moon, * even in the time appointed, and upon our solemn feast-day.
4 For this was made a statute for Israel, * and a law of the God of Jacob.
5 This he ordained in Joseph for a testimony, * when he came out of the land of Egypt, and had heard a
strange language.
6 I eased his shoulder from the burden, * and his hands were delivered from making the pots.
7 Thou calledst upon me in troubles, and I delivered thee; * and heard thee what time as the storm fell upon
thee.
8 I proved thee also * at the waters of strife.
9 Hear, O my people; and I will assure thee, O Israel, * if thou wilt harken unto me,
10 There shall no strange god be in thee, * neither shalt thou worship any other god.
11 I am the LORD thy God, who brought thee out of the land of Egypt: * open thy mouth wide, and I shall
fill it.
12 But my people would not hear my voice; * and Israel would not obey me;
13 So I gave them up unto their own hearts’ lusts, * and let them follow their own imaginations.
14 O that my people would have harkened unto me! * for if Israel had walked in my ways,
15 I should soon have put down their enemies, * and turned my hand against their adversaries. 
16 The haters of the LORD should have submitted themselves unto him; * but their time should have
endured forever.
17 I would have fed them also with the finest wheat-flour; * and with honey out of the stony rock would I
have satisfied thee.
18 Glory be to the Father, and tó the Són, * and to the Hóly Ghóst;
19 As it was in the beginning, † is now, and éver sháll be, * world wíthout énd.
 Amen.
Evening Prayer
Psalm 82. Deus stetit.
GOD standeth in the congregation of princes; * he is a Judge among gods.
2 How long will ye give wrong judgment, * and accept the persons of the ungodly?
3 Defend the poor and fatherless; * see that such as are in need and necessity have right.
4 Deliver the outcast and poor; * save them from the hand of the ungodly.
5 They know not, neither do they understand, but walk on still in darkness: * all the foundations of the
earth are out of course.
6 I have said, Ye are gods, * and ye are all the children of the Most Highest.
7 But ye shall die like men, * and fall like one of the princes.
8 Arise, O God, and judge thou the earth; * for thou shalt take all nations to thine inheritance.
9 Glory be to the Father, and tó the Són, * and to the Hóly Ghóst;
10 As it was in the beginning, † is now, and éver sháll be, * world wíthout énd.
 Amen.
Psalm 83. Deus, quis similis?
HOLD not thy tongue, O God, keep not still silence: * refrain not thyself, O God.
2 For lo, thine enemies make a murmuring; * and they that hate thee have lift up their head.
3 They have imagined craftily against thy people, * and taken counsel against thy secret ones.
4 They have said, Come, and let us root them out, that they be no more a people, * and that the name of
Israel may be no more in remembrance.
5 For they have cast their heads together with one consent, * and are confederate against thee:
6 The tabernacles of the Edomites, and the Ishmaelites; * the Moabites, and Hagarenes;
7 Gebal, and Ammon, and Amalek; * the Philistines, with them that dwell at Tyre.
8 Assyria also is joined with them; * they have holpen the children of Lot.
9 But do thou to them as unto the Midianites; * unto Sisera, and unto Jabin at the brook of Kishon;
10 Who perished at Endor, * and became as the dung of the earth.
11 Make them and their princes like Oreb and Zeeb; * yea, make all their princes like as Zebah and
Zalmunna;
12 Who say, Let us take to ourselves * the houses of God in possession.
13 O my God, make them like unto the whirling dust, * and as the stubble before the wind;
14 Like as the fire that burneth up the forest, * and as the flame that consumeth the mountains;
15 Pursue them even so with thy tempest, * and make them afraid with thy storm.
16 Make their faces ashamed, O LORD, * that they may seek thy Name.
17 Let them be confounded and vexed ever more and more; * let them be put to shame, and perish.
18 And they shall know that thou, whose Name is JEHOVAH, * art only the Most Highest over all the
earth.
19 Glory be to the Father, and tó the Són, * and to the Hóly Ghóst;
20 As it was in the beginning, † is now, and éver sháll be, * world wíthout énd.
 Amen.
Psalm 84. Quam dilecta!
O HOW amiable are thy dwellings, * thou LORD of hosts.
2 My soul hath a desire and longing to enter into the courts of the LORD; * my heart and my flesh rejoice in
the living God.
3 Yea, the sparrow hath found her an house, and the swallow a nest, where she may lay her young; * even
thy altars, O LORD of hosts, my King and my God.
4 Blessed are they that dwell in thy house; * they will be alway praising thee.
5 Blessed is the man whose strength is in thee; * in whose heart are thy ways.
6 Who going through the vale of misery use it for a well; * and the pools are filled with water.
7 They will go from strength to strength, * and unto the God of gods appeareth every one of them in Sion.
8 O LORD God of hosts, hear my prayer; * harken, O God of Jacob. 
9 Behold, O God our defender, * and look upon the face of thine anointed.
10 For one day in thy courts * is better than a thousand.
11 I had rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God, * than to dwell in the tents of ungodliness.
12 For the LORD God is a light and defense; * the LORD will give grace and worship; and no good thing
shall he withhold from them that live a godly life.
13 O LORD God of hosts, * blessed is the man that putteth his trust in thee.
14 Glory be to the Father, and tó the Són, * and to the Hóly Ghóst;
15 As it was in the beginning, † is now, and éver sháll be, * world wíthout énd.
 Amen.
Psalm 85. Benedixisti, Domine.
LORD, thou art become gracious unto thy land; * thou hast turned away the captivity of Jacob.
2 Thou hast forgiven the offence of thy people, * and covered all their sins.
3 Thou hast taken away all thy displeasure, * and turned thyself from thy wrathful indignation.
4 Turn us then, O God our Savior, * and let thine anger cease from us.
5 Wilt thou be displeased at us forever? * and wilt thou stretch out thy wrath from one generation to
another?
6 Wilt thou not turn again, and quicken us, * that thy people may rejoice in thee?
7 Show us thy mercy, O LORD, * and grant us thy salvation.
8 I will harken what the LORD God will say; * for he shall speak peace unto his people, and to his saints,
that they turn not again unto foolishness.
9 For his salvation is nigh them that fear him; * that glory may dwell in our land.
10 Mercy and truth are met together: * righteousness and peace have kissed each other.
11 Truth shall flourish out of the earth, * and righteousness hath looked down from heaven.
12 Yea, the LORD shall show loving-kindness; * and our land shall give her increase.
13 Righteousness shall go before him, * and shall direct his going in the way.
14 Glory be to the Father, and tó the Són, * and to the Hóly Ghóst;
15 As it was in the beginning, † is now, and éver sháll be, * world wíthout énd.
 Amen.
THE SEVENTEENTH DAY
Morning Prayer
Psalm 86. Inclina, Domine.
BOW down thine ear, O LORD, and hear me; * for I am poor, and in misery.
2 Preserve thou my soul, for I am holy: * my God, save thy servant that putteth his trust in thee.
3 Be merciful unto me, O Lord; * for I will call daily upon thee.
4 Comfort the soul of thy servant; * for unto thee, O Lord, do I lift up my soul.
5 For thou, Lord, art good and gracious, * and of great mercy unto all them that call upon thee.
6 Give ear, LORD, unto my prayer, * and ponder the voice of my humble desires.
7 In the time of my trouble I will call upon thee; * for thou hearest me.
8 Among the gods there is none like unto thee, O Lord; * there is not one that can do as thou doest.
9 All nations whom thou hast made shall come and worship thee, O Lord; * and shall glorify thy Name.
10 For thou art great, and doest wondrous things: * thou art God alone.
11 Teach me thy way, O LORD, and I will walk in thy truth: * O knit my heart unto thee, that I may fear thy
Name.
12 I will thank thee, O Lord my God, with all my heart; * and will praise thy Name forevermore.
13 For great is thy mercy toward me; * and thou hast delivered my soul from the nethermost hell.
14 O God, the proud are risen against me; * and the congregations of violent men have sought after my
soul, and have not set thee before their eyes.
15 But thou, O Lord God, art full of compassion and mercy, * long-suffering, plenteous in goodness and
truth.
16 O turn thee then unto me, and have mercy upon me; * give thy strength unto thy servant, and help the
son of thine handmaid.
17 Show some token upon me for good; that they who hate me may see it, and be ashamed, * because thou,
LORD, hast holpen me, and comforted me.
18 Glory be to the Father, and tó the Són, * and to the Hóly Ghóst;
19 As it was in the beginning, † is now, and éver sháll be, * world wíthout énd.
 Amen.
Psalm 87. Fundamenta ejus. 
HER foundations are upon the holy hills: * the LORD loveth the gates of Sion more than all the dwellings of
Jacob.
2 Very excellent things are spoken of thee, * thou city of God.
3 I will make mention of Egypt and Babylon, * among them that know me.
4 Behold, Philistia also; and Tyre, with Ethiopia; * lo, in Sion were they born.
5 Yea, of Sion it shall be reported, this one and that one were born in her; * and the Most High shall
stablish her.
6 The LORD shall record it, when he writeth up the peoples; * lo, in Sion were they born.
7 The singers also and trumpeters shall make answer: * All my fresh springs are in thee.
8 Glory be to the Father, and tó the Són, * and to the Hóly Ghóst;
9 As it was in the beginning, † is now, and éver sháll be, * world wíthout énd.
 Amen.
Psalm 88. Domine, Deus.
O LORD God of my salvation, I have cried day and night before thee: * O let my prayer enter into thy
presence, incline thine ear unto my calling;
2 For my soul is full of trouble, * and my life draweth nigh unto the grave.
3 I am counted as one of them that go down into the pit, * and I am even as a man that hath no strength;
4 Cast off among the dead, like unto them that are slain, and lie in the grave, * who are out of
remembrance, and are cut away from thy hand.
5 Thou hast laid me in the lowest pit, * in a place of darkness, and in the deep.
6 Thine indignation lieth hard upon me, * and thou hast vexed me with all thy storms.
7 Thou hast put away mine acquaintance far from me, * and made me to be abhorred of them.
8 I am so fast in prison * that I cannot get forth.
9 My sight faileth for very trouble; * LORD, I have called daily upon thee, I have stretched forth my hands
unto thee.
10 Dost thou show wonders among the dead? * or shall the dead rise up again, and praise thee?
11 Shall thy loving-kindness be showed in the grave? * or thy faithfulness in destruction?
12 Shall thy wondrous works be known in the dark? * and thy righteousness in the land where all things are
forgotten?
13 Unto thee have I cried, O LORD; * and early shall my prayer come before thee.
14 LORD, why abhorrest thou my soul, * and hidest thou thy face from me?
15 I am in misery, and like unto him that is at the point to die; * even from my youth up, thy terrors have I
suffered with a troubled mind.
16 Thy wrathful displeasure goeth over me, * and the fear of thee hath undone me.
17 They came round about me daily like water, * and compassed me together on every side.
18 My lovers and friends hast thou put away from me, * and hid mine acquaintance out of my sight.
19 Glory be to the Father, and tó the Són, * and to the Hóly Ghóst;
20 As it was in the beginning, † is now, and éver sháll be, * world wíthout énd.
 Amen.
Evening Prayer
Psalm 89.
I. Misericordias Domini.
MY song shall be alway of the loving-kindness of the LORD; * with my mouth will I ever be showing thy
truth from one generation to another.
2 For I have said, Mercy shall be set up forever; * thy truth shalt thou stablish in the heavens.
3 I have made a covenant with my chosen; * I have sworn unto David my servant:
4 Thy seed will I stablish forever, * and set up thy throne from one generation to another.
5 O LORD, the very heavens shall praise thy wondrous works; * and thy truth in the congregation of the
saints.
6 For who is he among the clouds, * that shall be compared unto the LORD?
7 And what is he among the gods, * that shall be like unto the LORD?
8 God is very greatly to be feared in the council of the saints, * and to be had in reverence of all them that
are round about him.
9 O Lord God of hosts, who is like unto thee? * thy truth, most mighty LORD, is on every side.
10 Thou rulest the raging of the sea; * thou stillest the waves thereof when they arise.
11 Thou hast subdued Egypt, and destroyed it; * thou hast scattered thine enemies abroad with thy mighty
arm. 
12 The heavens are thine, the earth also is thine; * thou hast laid the foundation of the round world, and all
that therein is.
13 Thou hast made the north and the south; * Tabor and Hermon shall rejoice in thy Name.
14 Thou hast a mighty arm; * strong is thy hand, and high is thy right hand.
15 Righteousness and equity are the habitation of thy seat; * mercy and truth shall go before thy face.
16 Blessed is the people, O LORD, that can rejoice in thee; * they shall walk in the light of thy countenance.
17 Their delight shall be daily in thy Name; * and in thy righteousness shall they make their boast.
18 For thou art the glory of their strength, * and in thy loving-kindness thou shalt lift up our horns.
19 For the LORD is our defense; * the Holy One of Israel is our King.
Glory be to the Father, and tó the Són, * and to the Hóly Ghóst;
As it was in the beginning, † is now, and éver sháll be, * world wíthout énd.
 Amen.
II. Tunc locutus es
THOU spakest sometime in visions unto thy saints, and saidst, * I have laid help upon one that is mighty, I
have exalted one chosen out of the people.
21 I have found David my servant; * with my holy oil have I anointed him.
22 My hand shall hold him fast, * and my arm shall strengthen him.
23 The enemy shall not be able to do him violence; * the son of wickedness shall not hurt him.
24 I will smite down his foes before his face, * and plague them that hate him.
25 My truth also and my mercy shall be with him; * and in my Name shall his horn be exalted.
26 I will set his dominion also in the sea, * and his right hand in the floods.
27 He shall call me, Thou art my Father, * my God, and my strong salvation.
28 And I will make him my firstborn, * higher than the kings of the earth.
29 My mercy will I keep for him forevermore, * and my covenant shall stand fast with him.
30 His seed also will I make to endure forever, * and his throne as the days of heaven.
31 But if his children forsake my law, * and walk not in my judgments;
32 If they break my statutes, and keep not my commandments; * I will visit their offences with the rod, and
their sin with scourges.
33 Nevertheless, my loving-kindness will I not utterly take from him, * nor suffer my truth to fail.
34 My covenant will I not break, nor alter the thing that is gone out of my lips: * I have sworn once by my
holiness, that I will not fail David.
35 His seed shall endure forever, * and his throne is like as the sun before me.
36 He shall stand fast forevermore as the moon, * and as the faithful witness in heaven.
37 But thou hast abhorred and forsaken thine anointed, * and art displeased at him.
38 Thou hast broken the covenant of thy servant, * and cast his crown to the ground.
39 Thou hast overthrown all his hedges, * and broken down his strongholds.
40 All they that go by spoil him, * and he is become a reproach to his neighbors.
41 Thou hast set up the right hand of his enemies, * and made all his adversaries to rejoice.
42 Thou hast taken away the edge of his sword, * and givest him not victory in the battle.
43 Thou hast put out his glory, * and cast his throne down to the ground.
44 The days of his youth hast thou shortened, * and covered him with dishonor.
45 LORD, how long wilt thou hide thyself? forever? * and shall thy wrath burn like fire?
46 O remember how short my time is; * wherefore hast thou made all men for nought?
47 What man is he that liveth, and shall not see death? * and shall he deliver his soul from the power of the
grave?
48 Lord, where are thy old loving-kindnesses, * which thou swarest unto David in thy truth?
49 Remember, Lord, the rebuke that thy servants have, * and how I do bear in my bosom the rebukes of
many people;
50 Wherewith thine enemies have blasphemed thee, * and slandered the footsteps of thine anointed.
51 Praised be the LORD forevermore. * Amen, and Amen.
Glory be to the Father, and tó the Són, * and to the Hóly Ghóst;
As it was in the beginning, † is now, and éver sháll be, * world wíthout énd.
 Amen.
BOOK IV
THE EIGHTEENTH DAY
Morning Prayer
Psalm 90. Domine, refugium. 
LORD, thou hast been our refuge, * from one generation to another.
2 Before the mountains were brought forth, or ever the earth and the world were made, * thou art God from
everlasting, and world without end.
3 Thou turnest man to destruction; * again thou sayest, Come again, ye children of men.
4 For a thousand years in thy sight are but as yesterday when it is past, * and as a watch in the night.
5 As soon as thou scatterest them they are even as a sleep; * and fade away suddenly like the grass.
6 In the morning it is green, and groweth up; * but in the evening it is cut down, dried up, and withered.
7 For we consume away in thy displeasure, * and are afraid at thy wrathful indignation.
8 Thou hast set our misdeeds before thee; * and our secret sins in the light of thy countenance.
9 For when thou art angry all our days are gone: * we bring our years to an end, as it were a tale that is told.
10 The days of our age are threescore years and ten; and though men be so strong that they come to
fourscore years, * yet is their strength then but labor and sorrow; so soon passeth it away, and we are
gone.
11 But who regardeth the power of thy wrath? * or feareth aright thy indignation?
12 So teach us to number our days, * that we may apply our hearts unto wisdom.
13 Turn thee again, O LORD, at the last, * and be gracious unto thy servants.
14 O satisfy us with thy mercy, and that soon: * so shall we rejoice and be glad all the days of our life.
15 Comfort us again now after the time that thou hast plagued us; * and for the years wherein we have
suffered adversity.
16 Show thy servants thy work, * and their children thy glory.
17 And the glorious majesty of the LORD our God be upon us: * prosper thou the work of our hands upon
us; O prosper thou our handy-work.
18 Glory be to the Father, and tó the Són, * and to the Hóly Ghóst;
19 As it was in the beginning, † is now, and éver sháll be, * world wíthout énd.
 Amen.
Psalm 91. Qui habitat.
WHOSO dwelleth under the defense of the Most High, * shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty.
2 I will say unto the LORD, Thou art my hope, and my stronghold; * my God, in him will I trust.
3 For he shall deliver thee from the snare of the hunter, * and from the noisome pestilence.
4 He shall defend thee under his wings, and thou shalt be safe under his feathers; * his faithfulness and
truth shall be thy shield and buckler.
5 Thou shalt not be afraid for any terror by night, * nor for the arrow that flieth by day;
6 For the pestilence that walketh in darkness, * nor for the sickness that destroyeth in the noonday.
7 A thousand shall fall beside thee, and ten thousand at thy right hand; * but it shall not come nigh thee.
8 Yea, with thine eyes shalt thou behold, * and see the reward of the ungodly.
9 For thou, LORD, art my hope; * thou hast set thine house of defense very high.
10 There shall no evil happen unto thee, * neither shall any plague come nigh thy dwelling.
11 For he shall give his angels charge over thee, * to keep thee in all thy ways.
12 They shall bear thee in their hands, * that thou hurt not thy foot against a stone.
13 Thou shalt go upon the lion and adder: * the young lion and the dragon shalt thou tread under thy feet.
14 Because he hath set his love upon me, therefore will I deliver him; * I will set him up, because he hath
known my Name.
15 He shall call upon me, and I will hear him; * yea, I am with him in trouble; I will deliver him, and bring
him to honor.
16 With long life will I satisfy him, * and show him my salvation.
17 Glory be to the Father, and tó the Són, * and to the Hóly Ghóst;
18 As it was in the beginning, † is now, and éver sháll be, * world wíthout énd.
 Amen.
Psalm 92. Bonum est confiteri.
IT is a good thing to give thanks unto the LORD, * and to sing praises unto thy Name, O Most Highest;
2 To tell of thy loving-kindness early in the morning, * and of thy truth in the night season;
3 Upon an instrument of ten strings, and upon the lute; * upon a loud instrument, and upon the harp.
4 For thou, LORD, hast made me glad through thy works; * and I will rejoice in giving praise for the
operations of thy hands.
5 O LORD, how glorious are thy works! * thy thoughts are very deep.
6 An unwise man doth not well consider this, * and a fool doth not understand it.
7 When the ungodly are green as the grass, and when all the workers of wickedness do flourish, * then shall
they be destroyed forever; but thou, LORD, art the Most Highest forevermore. 
8 For lo, thine enemies, O LORD, lo, thine enemies shall perish; * and all the workers of wickedness shall
be destroyed.
9 But my horn shall be exalted like the horn of an unicorn; * for I am anointed with fresh oil.
10 Mine eye also shall see his lust of mine enemies, * and mine ear shall hear his desire of the wicked that

Evening Prayer
Psalm 93. Dominus regnavit.
THE LORD is King, and hath put on glorious apparel; * the LORD hath put on his apparel, and girded
himself with strength.
2 He hath made the round world so sure, * that it cannot be moved.
3 Ever since the world began, hath thy seat been prepared: * thou art from everlasting.
4 The floods are risen, O LORD, the floods have lift up their voice; * the floods lift up their waves.
5 The waves of the sea are mighty, and rage horribly; * but yet the LORD, who dwelleth on high, is
mightier.
6 Thy testimonies, O LORD, are very sure: * holiness becometh thine house forever.
7 Glory be to the Father, and tó the Són, * and to the Hóly Ghóst;

Psalm 94. Deus ultionum.
O LORD God, to whom vengeance belongeth, * thou God, to whom vengeance belongeth, show thyself.
2 Arise, thou Judge of the world, * and reward the proud after their deserving.
3 LORD, how long shall the ungodly, * how long shall the ungodly triumph?
4 How long shall all wicked doers speak so disdainfully, * and make such proud boasting?
5 They smite down thy people, O LORD, * and trouble thine heritage.
6 They murder the widow and the stranger, * and put the fatherless to death.
7 And yet they say, Tush, the LORD shall not see, * neither shall the God of Jacob regard it.
8 Take heed, ye unwise among the people: * O ye fools, when will ye understand?
9 He that planted the ear, shall he not hear? * or he that made the eye, shall he not see?
10 Or he that instructeth the heathen, * it is he that teacheth man knowledge; shall not he punish?
11 The LORD knoweth the thoughts of man, * that they are but vain.
12 Blessed is the man whom thou chastenest, O LORD, * and teachest him in thy law;
13 That thou mayest give him patience in time of adversity, * until the pit be digged up for the ungodly.
14 For the LORD will not fail his people; * neither will he forsake his inheritance;
15 Until righteousness turn again unto judgment: * all such as are true in heart shall follow it.
16 Who will rise up with me against the wicked? * or who will take my part against the evil doers?
17 If the LORD had not helped me, * it had not failed, but my soul had been put to silence.
18 But when I said, My foot hath slipped; * thy mercy, O LORD, held me up.
19 In the multitude of the sorrows that I had in my heart, * thy comforts have refreshed my soul.
20 Wilt thou have any thing to do with the throne of wickedness, * which imagineth mischief as a law?
21 They gather them together against the soul of the righteous, * and condemn the innocent blood.
22 But the LORD is my refuge, * and my God is the strength of my confidence.
23 He shall recompense them their wickedness, and destroy them in their own malice; * yea, the LORD our
God shall destroy them.
24 Glory be to the Father, and tó the Són, * and to the Hóly Ghóst;
25 As it was in the beginning, † is now, and éver sháll be, * world wíthout énd.
 Amen.

THE TWENTIETH DAY
Morning Prayer
Psalm 102. Domine, exaudi.
HEAR my prayer, O LORD, * and let my crying come unto thee.
2 Hide not thy face from me in the time of my trouble; * incline thine ear unto me when I call; O hear me,
and that right soon.
3 For my days are consumed away like smoke, * and my bones are burnt up as it were a firebrand.
4 My heart is smitten down, and withered like grass; * so that I forget to eat my bread.
5 For the voice of my groaning, * my bones will scarce cleave to my flesh.
6 I am become like a pelican in the wilderness, * and like an owl that is in the desert.
7 I have watched, and am even as it were a sparrow, * that sitteth alone upon the housetop.
8 Mine enemies revile me all the day long; * and they that are mad upon me are sworn together against me.
9 For I have eaten ashes as it were bread, * and mingled my drink with weeping;
10 And that, because of thine indignation and wrath; * for thou hast taken me up, and cast me down.
11 My days are gone like a shadow, * and I am withered like grass.
12 But thou, O LORD, shalt endure forever, * and thy remembrance throughout all generations.
13 Thou shalt arise, and have mercy upon Sion; * for it is time that thou have mercy upon her, yea, the time
is come.
14 And why? thy servants think upon her stones, * and it pitieth them to see her in the dust.
15 The nations shall fear thy Name, O LORD; * and all the kings of the earth thy majesty;
16 When the LORD shall build up Sion, * and when his glory shall appear;
17 When he turneth him unto the prayer of the poor destitute, * and despiseth not their desire.
18 This shall be written for those that come after, * and the people which shall be born shall praise the
LORD.
19 For he hath looked down from his sanctuary; * out of the heaven did the LORD behold the earth;
20 That he might hear the mournings of such as are in captivity, * and deliver them that are appointed unto
death;
21 That they may declare the Name of the LORD in Sion, * and his worship at Jerusalem;
22 When the peoples are gathered together, * and the kingdoms also, to serve the LORD.
23 He brought down my strength in my journey, * and shortened my days.
24 But I said, O my God, take me not away in the midst of mine age; * as for thy years, they endure
throughout all generations.
25 Thou, Lord, in the beginning hast laid the foundation of the earth, * and the heavens are the work of thy
hands.
26 They shall perish, but thou shalt endure: * they all shall wax old as doth a garment;
27 And as a vesture shalt thou change them, and they shall be changed; * but thou art the same, and thy
years shall not fail.
28 The children of thy servants shall continue, * and their seed shall stand fast in thy sight.
29 Glory be to the Father, and tó the Són, * and to the Hóly Ghóst;
30 As it was in the beginning, † is now, and éver sháll be, * world wíthout énd.
 Amen.
Psalm 103. Benedic, anima mea.
PRAISE the LORD, O my soul; * and all that is within me, praise his holy Name.
2 Praise the LORD, O my soul, * and forget not all his benefits:
3 Who forgiveth all thy sin, * and healeth all thine infirmities;
4 Who saveth thy life from destruction, * and crowneth thee with mercy and loving-kindness;
5 Who satisfieth thy mouth with good things, * making thee young and lusty as an eagle.
6 The LORD executeth righteousness and judgment * for all them that are oppressed with wrong.
7 He showed his ways unto Moses, * his works unto the children of Israel.
8 The LORD is full of compassion and mercy, * long-suffering, and of great goodness. 
9 He will not alway be chiding; * neither keepeth he his anger forever.
10 He hath not dealt with us after our sins; * nor rewarded us according to our wickednesses.
11 For look how high the heaven is in comparison of the earth; * so great is his mercy also toward them
that fear him.
12 Look how wide also the east is from the west; * so far hath he set our sins from us.
13 Yea, like as a father pitieth his own children; * even so is the LORD merciful unto them that fear him.
14 For he knoweth whereof we are made; * he remembereth that we are but dust.
15 The days of man are but as grass; * for he flourisheth as a flower of the field.
16 For as soon as the wind goeth over it, it is gone; * and the place thereof shall know it no more.
17 But the merciful goodness of the LORD endureth for ever and ever upon them that fear him; * and his
righteousness upon children’s children;
18 Even upon such as keep his covenant, * and think upon his commandments to do them.
19 The LORD hath prepared his seat in heaven, * and his kingdom ruleth over all.
20 O praise the LORD, ye angels of his, ye that excel in strength; * ye that fulfill his commandment, and
harken unto the voice of his word.
21 O praise the LORD, all ye his hosts; * ye servants of his that do his pleasure.
22 O speak good of the LORD, all ye works of his, in all places of his dominion: * praise thou the LORD, O
my soul.
23 Glory be to the Father, and tó the Són, * and to the Hóly Ghóst;
24 As it was in the beginning, † is now, and éver sháll be, * world wíthout énd.
 Amen.
Evening Prayer
Psalm 104. Benedic, anima mea.
PRAISE the LORD, O my soul: * O LORD my God, thou art become exceeding glorious; thou art clothed
with majesty and honor.
2 Thou deckest thyself with light as it were with a garment, * and spreadest out the heavens like a curtain.
3 Who layeth the beams of his chambers in the waters, * and maketh the clouds his chariot, and walketh
upon the wings of the wind.
4 He maketh his angels winds, * and his ministers a flaming fire.
5 He laid the foundations of the earth, * that it never should move at any time.
6 Thou coveredst it with the deep like as with a garment; * the waters stand above the hills.
7 At thy rebuke they flee; * at the voice of thy thunder they haste away.
8 They go up as high as the hills, and down to the valleys beneath; * even unto the place which thou hast
appointed for them.
9 Thou hast set them their bounds, which they shall not pass, * neither turn again to cover the earth.
10 He sendeth the springs into the rivers, * which run among the hills.
11 All beasts of the field drink thereof, * and the wild asses quench their thirst.
12 Beside them shall the fowls of the air have their habitation, * and sing among the branches.
13 He watereth the hills from above; * the earth is filled with the fruit of thy works.
14 He bringeth forth grass for the cattle, * and green herb for the service of men;
15 That he may bring food out of the earth, and wine that maketh glad the heart of man; * and oil to make
him a cheerful countenance, and bread to strengthen man’s heart.
16 The trees of the LORD also are full of sap; * even the cedars of Lebanon which he hath planted;
17 Wherein the birds make their nests; * and the fir trees are a dwelling for the stork.
18 The high hills are a refuge for the wild goats; * and so are the stony rocks for the conies.
19 He appointed the moon for certain seasons, * and the sun knoweth his going down.
20 Thou makest darkness that it may be night; * wherein all the beasts of the forest do move.
21 The lions, roaring after their prey, * do seek their meat from God.
22 The sun ariseth, and they get them away together, * and lay them down in their dens.
23 Man goeth forth to his work, and to his labor, * until the evening.
24 O LORD, how manifold are thy works! * in wisdom hast thou made them all; the earth is full of thy
riches.
25 So is the great and wide sea also; * wherein are things creeping innumerable, both small and great
beasts.
26 There go the ships, and there is that leviathan, * whom thou hast made to take his pastime therein.
27 These wait all upon thee, * that thou mayest give them meat in due season.
28 When thou givest it them, they gather it; * and when thou openest thy hand, they are filled with good.
29 When thou hidest thy face, they are troubled: * when thou takest away their breath, they die, and are
turned again to their dust. 
30 When thou lettest thy breath go forth, they shall be made; * and thou shalt renew the face of the earth.
31 The glorious majesty of the LORD shall endure forever; * the LORD shall rejoice in his works.
32 The earth shall tremble at the look of him; * if he do but touch the hills, they shall smoke.
33 I will sing unto the LORD as long as I live; * I will praise my God while I have my being.
34 And so shall my words please him: * my joy shall be in the LORD.
35 As for sinners, they shall be consumed out of the earth, * and the ungodly shall come to an end.
36 Praise thou the LORD, O my soul. * Praise the LORD.
37 Glory be to the Father, and tó the Són, * and to the Hóly Ghóst;
38 As it was in the beginning, † is now, and éver sháll be, * world wíthout énd.
 Amen.
Psalm 105.
I. Confitemini Domino.
O GIVE thanks unto the LORD, and call upón his Náme; * tell the people what thíngs he hath dóne.
2 O let your songs be of hím, and praíse him; * and let your talking be of all his wóndrous wórks.
3 Rejoice in his hóly Náme; * let the heart of them rejoice that seék the LÓRD.
4 Seek the LÓRD and his stréngth; * seek his fáce evermóre.
5 Remember the marvelous works that hé hath dóne; * his wonders, and the judgments óf his moúth;
6 O ye seed of Abrahám his sérvant, * ye children of Jácob his chósen.
7 He is the LÓRD our Gód; * his judgments are in áll the wórld.
8 He hath been alway mindful of his covenánt and prómise, * that he made to a thousand génerátions;
9 Even the covenant that he made with Ábrahám; * and the oath that he swáre unto Ísaac;
10 And appointed the same unto Jacob fór a láw, * and to Israel for an everlasting téstamént;
11 Saying, Unto thee will I give the lánd of Cánaan, * the lot of your inhéritánce:
12 When there were yet but a féw of thém, * and they strangers ín the lánd;
13 What time as they went from one nation tó anóther, * from one kingdom to anóther peóple;
14 He suffered no man to dó them wróng, * but reproved even kíngs for their sákes;
15 Touch not míne anoínted, * and do my próphets no hárm.
16 Moreover, he called for a dearth upón the lánd, * and destroyed all the provísion of breád.
17 But he had sent a mán befóre them, * even Joseph, who was sold to bé a bónd-servant;
18 Whose feet they húrt in the stócks; * the iron entered ínto his sóul;
19 Until the time came that his caúse was knówn: * the word of the LŐRD tríed him.
20 The king sent, and delívered hím; * the prince of the people lét him go freé.
21 He made him lord also óf his hoúse, * and ruler of áll his súbstance;
22 That he might inform his princes áfter his wíll, * and teach his sénators wísdom.
Glory be to the Father, and tó the Són, * and to the Hóly Ghóst;
As it was in the beginning, † is now, and éver sháll be, * world wíthout énd.
 Amen.
II. Et intravit Israel
ISRAEL also came ínto Égypt, * and Jacob was a stranger in the lánd of Hám.
24 And he increased his people exceédinglÿ, * and made them stronger than their énemíes;
25 Whose heart turned so, that they háted his peóple, * and dealt untruly wíth his sérvants.
26 Then sent he Móses his sérvant, * and Aaron whom hé had chósen.
27 And these showed his tókens amóng them, * and wonders in the lánd of Hám.
28 He sent darkness, and ít was dárk; * and they were not obedient untó his wórd.
29 He turned their waters ínto bloód, * and sléw their físh.
30 Their land broúght forth frógs; * yea, even ín their kings’ chámbers.
31 He spake the word, and there came all mánner of fliés, * and lice in áll their quárters.
32 He gave them haílstones for raín; * and flames of fire ín their lánd.
33 He smote their vines álso and fíg trees; * and destroyed the trees that were ín their coásts.
34 He spake the word, and the grasshoppers came,† and caterpillars innúmerablé, * and did eat up all the
grass in their land,† and devoured the fruít of their groúnd.
35 He smote all the firstborn ín their lánd; * even the chief of áll their stréngth.
36 He brought them forth also with sílver and góld; * there was not one feeble person amóng their tríbes.
37 Egypt was glad at theír depárting; * for they were afraíd of thém.
38 He spread out a cloud to be a cóveríng, * and fire to give light ín the night seáson.
39 At their desíre he brought quaíls; * and he filled them with the breád of heáven.
40 He opened the rock of stone, and the wáters flowed oút, * so that rivers ran ín the dry pláces. 
41 For why? he remembered his hóly prómise; * and Abrahám his sérvant.
42 And he brought forth his peóple with jóy, * and his chósen with gládness;
43 And gave them the lánds of the heáthen; * and they took the labors of the people ín posséssion;
44 That they might keép his státutes, * and obsérve his láws.
Glory be to the Father, and tó the Són, * and to the Hóly Ghóst;
As it was in the beginning, † is now, and éver sháll be, * world wíthout énd.
 Amen.
Evening Prayer
Psalm 106.
I. Confitemini Domino.
O GIVE thanks unto the LORD; for hé is grácious, * and his mercy endúreth foréver.
2 Who can express the noble ácts of the LÓRD, * or show forth áll his praíse?
3 Blessed are they that álway keep júdgment, * and do ríghteousnéss.
4 Remember me, O LORD,† according to the favor that thou bearest untó thy peóple; * O visit me with thÿ
salvátion;
5 That I may see the felicity óf thy chósen, * and rejoice in the gladness of thy people,† and give thanks
with thine inhéritánce.
6 We have sínned with our fáthers; * we have done amiss, and dealt wíckedlÿ.
7 Our fathers regarded not thy wonders in Egypt,† neither kept they thy great goodness ín remémbrance; *
but were disobedient at the sea, even át the Red Seá.
8 Nevertheless, he helped them for hís Name’s sáke, * that he might make his pówer to be knówn.
9 He rebuked the Red Sea also, and ít was dried úp; * so he led them through the deep, as through a
wíldernéss.
10 And he saved them from the adversáry’s hánd, * and delivered them from the hand of the énemÿ.
11 As for those that troubled them, the waters óverwhélmed them; * there was not óne of them léft.
12 Then beliéved they his wórds, * and sang praíse unto hím.
13 But within a while they forgát his wórks, * and would not abíde his coúnsel.
14 But lust came upon them in the wíldernéss, * and they tempted Gód in the désert.
15 And he gave them theír desíre, * and sent leanness withal ínto their soúl.
16 They angered Moses also ín the ténts, * and Aaron the saínt of the LÓRD.
17 So the earth opened, and swállowed up Dáthan, * and covered the congregation of Ábíram.
18 And the fire was kindled in their cómpanÿ; * the flame burnt up thé ungódly.
Glory be to the Father, and tó the Són, * and to the Hóly Ghóst;

 Amen.
II. Et fecerunt vitulum
THEY made a cálf in Hóreb, * and worshipped the mólten ímage.
20 Thus they túrned their glóry * into the similitude of a calf that eáteth háy.
21 And they forgat Gód their Sávior, * who had done so great thíngs in Égypt;
22 Wondrous works in the lánd of Hám; * and fearful things bÿ the Red Seá.
23 So he said he would have destroyed them,† had not Moses his chosen stood before him ín the gáp, * to
turn away his wrathful indignation,† lest he shoúld destróy them.
24 Yea, they thought scorn of that pleásant lánd, * and gave no credence untó his wórd;
25 But murmured ín their ténts, * and harkened not unto the voíce of the LÓRD.
26 Then lift he up his hánd agaínst them, * to overthrow them in the wíldernéss;
27 To cast out their seed amóng the nátions, * and to scatter them ín the lánds.
28 They joined themselves unto Baál-peór, * and ate the offerings óf the deád.
29 Thus they provoked him to anger with their ówn invéntions; * and the plague was greát amóng them.
30 Then stood up Phinehas, and ínterpósed; * and só the plague ceásed.
31 And that was counted unto him for ríghteousnéss, * among all posterities forévermóre.
32 They angered him also at the wáters of strífe, * so that he punished Moses fór their sákes;
33 Because they provóked his spírit, * so that he spake unadvisedly wíth his líps.
34 Neither destróyed they the heáthen, * as the LORD commánded thém;
35 But were mingled amóng the heáthen, * and leárned their wórks.
36 Insomuch that they wórshipped their ídols, which became a snáre unto thém; * yea, they offered their
sons and their daughters únto dévils;
37 And shed innocent blood,† even the blood of their sons and óf their daúghters, * whom they offered
unto the idols of Canaan;† and the land was defíled with bloód. 
38 Thus were they stained with theír own wórks, * and went a whoring with their ówn invéntions.
39 Therefore was the wrath of the LORD kindled agaínst his peóple, * insomuch that he abhorred his own
inhéritánce.
40 And he gave them over into the hánd of the heáthen; * and they that hated them were lords óver thém.
41 Their enemiés oppréssed them, * and had them ín subjéction.
42 Many a time did he delíver thém; * but they rebelled against him with their own inventions, and were
brought down in their wíckednéss.
43 Nevertheless, when he saw their advérsitÿ, * he heard theír complaínt.
44 He thought upon his covenant, and pitied them,† according unto the multitude óf his mércies; * yea, he
made all those that led them away captive to píty thém.
45 Deliver us, O LORD our God, and gather us from amóng the heáthen; * that we may give thanks unto thy
holy Name, and make our boást of thy praíse.
46 Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, from everlasting, and wórld without énd; * And let all the people
sáy, Amén.
Glory be to the Father, and tó the Són, * and to the Hóly Ghóst;
As it was in the beginning, † is now, and éver sháll be, * world wíthout énd.
 Amen.
BOOK V
THE TWENTY-SECOND DAY
Morning Prayer
Psalm 107.
I. Confitemini Domino.
O GIVE thanks unto the LORD, for hé is grácious, * and his mercy endúreth foréver.
2 Let them give thanks whom the LÓRD hath redeémed, * and delivered from the hand of the énemÿ;
3 And gathered them out of the lands, from the east, and fróm the wést; * from the north, and fróm the
soúth.
4 They went astray in the wilderness oút of the wáy, * and found no cíty to dwéll in.
5 Húngry and thírsty, * their soul faínted ín them.
6 So they cried unto the LÓRD in their troúble, * and he delivered them fróm their distréss.
7 He led them fórth by the ríght way, * that they might go to the city whére they dwélt.
8 O that men would therefore praise the LÓRD for his goódness; * and declare the wonders that he doeth
for the chíldren of mén!
9 For he satisfieth the émpty soúl, * and filleth the hungry soúl with goódness.
10 Such as sit in darkness, and in the shádow of deáth, * being fast bound in miserÿ and íron;
11 Because they rebelled against the wórds of the Lórd, * and lightly regarded the counsel of thé Most
Híghest;
12 He also brought down their heart through heávinéss: * they fell down, and there was nóne to hélp them.
13 So when they cried unto the LÓRD in their troúble, * he delivered them out of theír distréss.
14 For he brought them out of darkness,† and out of the shádow of deáth, * and brake their bónds in
súnder.
15 O that men would therefore praise the LÓRD for his goódness; * and declare the wonders that he doeth
for the chíldren of mén!
16 For he hath broken the gátes of bráss, * and smitten the bars of íron in súnder.
17 Foolish men are plagued for theír offénce, * and because of their wíckednéss.
18 Their soul abhorred all mánner of meát, * and they were even hard át death’s doór.
19 So when they cried unto the LÓRD in their troúble, * he delivered them out of theír distréss.
20 He sent his wórd, and heáled them; * and they were saved from theír destrúction.
21 O that men would therefore praise the LÓRD for his goódness; * and declare the wonders that he doeth
for the chíldren of mén!
22 That they would offer unto him the sacrifíce of thanksgíving, * and tell out his wórks with gládness!
23 They that go down to the séa in shíps, * and occupy their business ín great wáters;
24 These men see the wórks of the LÓRD, * and his wonders ín the deép.
25 For at his word the stormy wínd aríseth, * which lifteth up the wáves thereóf.
26 They are carried up to the heaven,† and down agaín to the deép; * their soul melteth away becaúse of
the troúble.
27 They reel to and fro, and stagger like a drúnken mán, * and are át their wit’s énd.
28 So when they cry unto the LÓRD in their troúble, * he delivereth them out of theír distréss.
29 For he maketh the stórm to ceáse, * so that the waves thereóf are stíll. 
30 Then are they glad, because they áre at rést; * and so he bringeth them unto the haven where théy would
bé.
31 O that men would therefore praise the LÓRD for his goódness; * and declare the wonders that he doeth
for the chíldren of mén!
32 That they would exalt him also in the congregation óf the peóple, * and praise him in the seát of the
élders!
Glory be to the Father, and tó the Són, * and to the Hóly Ghóst;
As it was in the beginning, † is now, and éver sháll be, * world wíthout énd.
 Amen.
II. Posuit flumina
HE turneth the floods into a wíldernéss, * and drieth up the wáter-spríngs.
34 A fruitful land máketh he bárren, * for the wickedness of them that dwéll thereín.
35 Again, he maketh the wilderness a stánding wáter, * and water-springs óf a dry groúnd.
36 And there he sétteth the húngry, * that they may build them a cíty to dwéll in;
37 That they may sow their lánd, and plant víneyards, * to yield them fruíts of íncrease.
38 He blesseth them, so that they multiply exceédinglÿ; * and suffereth not their cattle tó decreáse.
39 And again, when they are minished ánd brought lów * through oppression, through any plágue or
troúble;
40 Though he suffer them to be evil entreáted through tÿrants, * and let them wander out of the way in the
wíldernéss;
41 Yet helpeth he the poor out of míserÿ, * and maketh him households like a flóck of sheép.
42 The righteous will consider thís, and rejoíce; * and the mouth of all wickedness sháll be stópped.
43 Whoso is wise, will pónder these thíngs; * and they shall understand the loving-kindness óf the LÓRD.
Glory be to the Father, and tó the Són, * and to the Hóly Ghóst;
As it was in the beginning, † is now, and éver sháll be, * world wíthout énd.
 Amen.
Evening Prayer
Psalm 108. Paratum cor meum.
O GOD, my heart is ready, my heárt is reády; * I will sing, and give praise with the best member thát I
háve.
2 Awake, thou lúte and hárp; * I myself will awáke right eárly.
3 I will give thanks unto thee, O LORD, amóng the peóples; * I will sing praises unto thee amóng the
nátions.
4 For thy mercy is greater thán the heávens, * and thy truth reacheth untó the cloúds.
5 Set up thyself, O God, abóve the heávens, * and thy glory above áll the eárth;
6 That thy beloved may bé delívered: * let thy right hand save them, and heár thou mé.
7 God hath spoken in his hólinéss; * I will rejoice therefore, and divide Shechem,† and mete out the válley
of Súccoth.
8 Gilead is mine, and Manásseh is míne; * Ephraim also is the strength of my head;† Judah ís my láwgiver;
9 Moab is my wash-pot;† over Edom will I cast oút my shoé; * upon Philistia wíll I tríumph.
10 Who will lead me into thé strong cíty? * and who will bring me ínto Édom?
11 Hast not thou forsaken ús, O Gód? * and wilt not thou, O God, go fórth with our hósts?
12 O help us agaínst the énemy: * for vain is the hélp of mán.
13 Through God we shall dó great ácts; * and it is he that shall tread down our énemiés.
14 Glory be to the Father, and tó the Són, * and to the Hóly Ghóst;
15 As it was in the beginning, † is now, and éver sháll be, * world wíthout énd.
 Amen.
Psalm 109. Deus, laudem.
HOLD not thy tongue, O Gód of my praíse; * for the mouth of the ungodly, yea, the mouth of the deceitful
is ópened upón me.
2 And they have spoken against me wíth false tóngues; * they compassed me about also with words of
hatred,† and fought against me withóut a cáuse.
3 For the love that I had unto them, lo, they take now my cóntrary párt; * but I give myself únto práyer.
4 Thus have they rewarded me évil for goód, * and hatred for mÿ good wíll. 
5 Set thou an ungodly man to be rúler óver him, * and let an adversary stand at hís right hánd.
6 When sentence is given upon him, let him bé condémned; * and let his prayer be túrned into sín.
7 Let his dáys be féw; * and let another táke his óffice.
8 Let his children be fátherléss, * and his wífe a wídow.
9 Let his children be vagabonds, and bég their breád; * let them seek it also out of désolate pláces.
10 Let the extortioner consume áll that he háth; * and let the stranger spoíl his lábor.
11 Let there be no man to píty hím, * nor to have compassion upon his fátherless chíldren.
12 Let his posterity bé destróyed; * and in the next generation let his name be cleán put oút.
13 Let the wickedness of his fathers be had in remembrance in the síght of the LÓRD; * and let not the sin
of his mother be dóne awáy.
14 Let them alway be befóre the LÓRD, * that he may root out the memorial of them from óff the eárth;
15 And that, because his mind was nót to do goód; * but persecuted the poor helpless man,† that he might
slay him that was véxed at the heárt.
16 His delight was in cursing, and it shall happen únto hím; * he loved not blessing, therefore shall it be fár
from hím.
17 He clothed himself with cursing like as wíth a raíment, * and it shall come into his bowels like water,†
and like oil ínto his bónes.
18 Let it be unto him as the cloak that he háth upón him, * and as the girdle that he is alway gírded withál.
19 Let it thus happen from the LORD unto mine énemiés, * and to those that speak evil agaínst my soúl.
20 But deal thou with me, O LORD God, according únto thy Náme; * for sweét is thy mércy.
21 O deliver me, for I am hélpless and poór, * and my heart is woúnded withín me.
22 I go hence like the shadow thát depárteth, * and am driven awáy as the grásshopper.
23 My knees are weák through fásting; * my flesh is dried up for wánt of fátness.
24 I am become also a reproách unto thém: * they that look upon me sháke their heáds.
25 Help me, O LÓRD my Gód; * O save me according tó thy mércy;
26 And they shall know how that thís is thy hánd, * and that thou, LÓRD, hast dóne it.
27 Though they cúrse, yet bléss thou; * and let them be confounded that rise up against me;† but let thy
sérvant rejoíce.
28 Let mine adversaries be clóthed with sháme; * and let them cover themselves with their own confusion,
as wíth a cloák.
29 As for me, I will give great thanks unto the LÓRD with my moúth, * and praise him among the múltitúde;
30 For he shall stand at the right hánd of the poór, * to save his soul from unríghteous júdges.
31 Glory be to the Father, and tó the Són, * and to the Hóly Ghóst;
32 As it was in the beginning, † is now, and éver sháll be, * world wíthout énd.
 Amen.

Psalm 114. In exitu Israel.
WHEN Israel came oút of Égypt, * and the house of Jacob from amóng the strange peóple,

4 The mountains skípped like ráms, * and the little hílls like young sheép.
5 What aileth thee, O thou seá, that thou fléddest? * and thou Jordan, that thou wast dríven báck?
6 Ye mountains, that ye skípped like ráms? * and ye little hílls, like young sheép?

3 As for our God, he ís in heáven: * he hath done whatsoéver pleásed him.
4 Their idols are sílver and góld, * even the wórk of men’s hánds.
5 They have moúths, and speak nót; * eyes have théy, and see nót.
6 They have eárs, and hear nót; * noses have théy, and smell nót.
7 They have hands, and handle not;† feet have théy, and walk nót; * neither speak they throúgh their throát.

Psalm 116. Dilexi, quoniam.
MY delight is ín the LÓRD * because he hath heard the voíce of my práyer;
2 Because he hath inclined his eár unto mé; * therefore will I call upon him as lóng as I líve.
3 The snares of death compassed me roúnd aboút, * and the pains of hell gat hóld upón me.
4 I found trouble and heaviness;† then called I upon the Náme of the LÓRD; * O LORD, I beseech thee,
delíver my soúl.
5 Gracious is the LÓRD, and ríghteous; * yea, our God is mércifúl.
6 The LORD presérveth the símple: * I was in misery, ánd he hélped me.
7 Turn again then unto thy rést, O my soúl; * for the LORD hath rewárded theé.
8 And why? thou hast delivered my soúl from deáth, * mine eyes from tears, and my feét from fálling.
9 I will walk befóre the LÓRD * in the lánd of the líving.
10 I believed, and therefore will I speak;† but I wás sore troúbled: * I said in my haste, All mén are líars.
11 What reward shall I give untó the LÓRD * for all the benefits that he hath dóne unto mé?
12 I will receive the cúp of salvátion, * and call upon the Náme of the LÓRD.

4 Yea, let them now that fear the LÓRD conféss, * that his mercy endúreth foréver.
5 I called upon the LÓRD in troúble; * and the LORD heárd me at lárge.
6 The LORD is ón my síde; * I will not fear what man doeth únto mé.
7 The LORD taketh my part with thém that hélp me; * therefore shall I see my desire upon mine énemíes.
8 It is better to trúst in the LÓRD, * than to put any confidénce in mán.
9 It is better to trust in the LÓRD, * than to put any confidénce in prínces.
10 All nations compassed me roúnd aboút; * but in the Name of the LORD will Í destroy thém.
11 They kept me in on every side,† they kept me in, I say, on évery síde; * but in the Name of the LORD
will Í destroy thém.
12 They came about me like bees,† and are extinct even as the fire amóng the thórns; * for in the Name of

19 Open me the gates of ríghteousnéss, * that I may go into them, and give thanks untó the LÓRD.
20 This is the gáte of the LÓRD, * the righteous shall enter ínto ít.
21 I will thank thee; for thoú hast heárd me, * and art becóme my salvátion.
22 The same stone which the buílders refúsed, * is become the headstone ín the córner.
23 This ís the LORD’s dóing, * and it is marvelous ín our éyes.
24 This is the day which the LÓRD hath máde; * we will rejoice and be glád in ít.
25 Help me nów, O LÓRD: * O LORD, send us now prospéritÿ.
26 Blessed be he that cometh in the Náme of the LOÓRD: * we have wished you good luck,† we that are of
the hoúse of the LÓRD.
27 God is the LORD, who hath shówed us líght: * bind the sacrifice with cords, yea,† even unto the hórns of

THEY that put their trust in the Lord shall be éven as the mount Síon, * which may not be removed, but
standeth fást foréver.
2 The hills stand about Jerúsalém; * even so standeth the Lord round about his people, from this time forth
forévermóre.
3 For the sceptre of the ungodly shall not abide upon the lót of the ríghteous; * lest the righteous put their
hand únto wíckedness.
4 Do wéll, O Lórd, * unto those that are good and trué of heárt.
5 As for such as turn back unto their ówn wíckedness, * the Lord shall lead them forth with the evil doers;
but peace shall bé upon Ísrael.
6 Glory be to the Father, and tó the Són, * and to the Hóly Ghóst;

Evening Prayer
Psalm 126. In convertendo.
WHEN the Lord turned again the captívity of Síon, * then were we like unto thém that dreám.
2 Then was our mouth fílled with laúghter, * and our tóngue with jóy.
3 Then said they amóng the heáthen, * The Lord hath done great thíngs for thém.
4 Yea, the Lord hath done great things for ús alreády; * whéreof we rejóice.
5 Turn our captívity, O Lórd, * as the rívers in the soúth.
6 They that sów in teárs * shall réap in jóy.

Psalm 127. Nisi Dominus.
EXCEPT the Lord buíld the hoúse, * their labor is but lóst that buíld it.
2 Except the Lord kéep the cíty, * the watchman wáketh but in vaín.
3 It is but lost labor that ye haste to rise up early, and so late take rest, and eat the bréad of cárefulness; *
for so he giveth his belóved sléep.
4 Lo, children, and the fruít of the wómb, * are an heritage and gift that cómeth of the Lórd.
5 Like as the arrows in the hánd of the gíant, * even so are the yóung chíldren.

4 Thy children like the ólive bránches * round aboút thy táble.
5 Lo, thus shall the mán be bléssed * that feáreth the Lórd.
6 The Lord from out of Síon shall so bléss thee, * that thou shalt see Jerusalem in prosperity áll thy life

Psalm 129. Saepe expugnaverunt.
MANY a time have they fought against me from my yóuth úp, * may Ísrael now sáy;
2 Yea, many a time have they vexed me from my yóuth úp; * but they have not preváiled agáinst me.
3 The plowers plowed upón my báck, * and máde long fúrrows.
4 But the ríghteous Lórd * hath hewn the snares of the ungódly in piéces.
5 Let them be confounded and túrned báckward, * as many as have evil wíll at Síon.
6 Let them be even as the grass upón the hoúsetops, * which withereth afore it be grówn úp;
7 Whereof the mower filleth nót his hánd, * neither he that bindeth up the shéaves his bósom.
8 So that they who go by say not so much as, The Lord prósper yóu; * we wish you good luck in the Náme
of the Lórd.

OUT of the deep have I called unto theé, O Lórd; * Lord, heár my voíce.
2 O let thine ears consíder wéll * the voice of mý complaínt.
3 If thou, Lord, wilt be extreme to mark what is dóne amíss, * O Lord, whó may abíde it?
4 For there is mércy with theé; * therefore shalt thóu be féared.
5 I look for the Lord; my soul doth waít for hím; * in his wórd is my trúst.
6 My soul fleeth unto the Lord before the mórning wátch; * I say, before the mórning wátch.
7 O Israel, trust in the Lord; for with the Lórd there is mércy, * and with him is plénteous redémption.
8 And he shall redeem Ísraél * from áll his síns.

THE TWENTY-EIGHTH DAY
Morning Prayer
Psalm 132. Memento, Domine.
LORD, remémber Dávid, * and all his trouble:
2 How he sware untó the LÓRD, * and vowed a vow unto the Almighty Gód of Jácob:
3 I will not come within the tabernacle óf mine hoúse, * nor climb up ínto my béd;
4 I will not suffer mine eyes to sleep, nor mine éyelids to slúmber; * neither the temples of my head to take
ány rést;
5 Until I find out a place for the temple óf the LÓRD; * an habitation for the Mighty Gód of Jácob.
6 Lo, we heard of the sáme at Ephrátah, * and found it ín the woód.
7 We will go into his tábernácle, * and fall low on our knees befóre his foótstool.
8 Arise, O LORD, into thy résting-pláce; * thou, and the árk of thy stréngth. 
9 Let thy priests be clothed with ríghteousnéss; * and let thy saints sing with jóyfulnéss.
10 For thy servant Dávid’s sáke, * turn not away the face of thíne anoínted.
11 The LORD hath made a faithful oath únto Dávid, * and he shall not shrínk from ít:
12 Of the fruít of thy bódy * shall I set upón thy thróne.
13 If thy children will keep my covenant, and my testimonies that Í shall teách them; * their children also
shall sit upon thy throne forévermóre.
14 For the LORD hath chosen Sion to be an habitation fór himsélf; * he hath lónged for hér.
15 This shall be my rést foréver: * here will I dwell, for I have a delíght thereín.
16 I will bless her victuáls with íncrease, * and will satisfy her poór with breád.
17 I will deck her priésts with heálth, * and her saints shall rejoíce and síng.
18 There shall I make the horn of Dávid to floúrish: * I have ordained a lantern for míne anoínted.
19 As for his enemies, I shall clóthe them with sháme; * but upon himself sháll his crown floúrish.
20 Glory be to the Father, and tó the Són, * and to the Hóly Ghóst;
21 As it was in the beginning, † is now, and éver sháll be, * world wíthout énd.
 Amen.
Psalm 133. Ecce, quam bonum!
BEHOLD, how good and joyful a thíng it ís, * for brethren to dwell together in únitÿ!
2 It is like the precious oil upon the head, that ran down untó the beárd, * even unto Aaron’s beard, and
went down to the skírts of his clóthing.
3 Like as the déw of Hérmon, * which fell upon the híll of Síon.
4 For there the LORD prómised his bléssing, * and life foréver móre.
5 Glory be to the Father, and tó the Són, * and to the Hóly Ghóst;

3 Lift up your hands in the sánctuáry, * and praíse the LÓRD.
4 The LORD that made heáven and eárth * give thee blessing oút of Síon.

O PRAISE the LORD, laud ye the Náme of the LÓRD; * praise it, O ye servants óf the LÓRD;
2 Ye that stand in the hoúse of the LÓRD, * in the courts of the hoúse of our Gód.
3 O praise the LORD, for the LÓRD is grácious; * O sing praises unto his Name, for ít is lóvely.
4 For why? the LORD hath chosen Jacob untó himsélf, * and Israel for his ówn posséssion.
5 For I know that the LÓRD is greát, * and that our Lord is abóve all góds.
6 Whatsoever the LORD pleased, that did he in heaven, ánd in eárth; * and in the sea, and in áll deep pláces.
7 He bringeth forth the clouds from the énds of the wórld, * and sendeth forth lightnings with the rain,
bringing the winds out of his treásuriés.
8 He smote the firstbórn of Égypt, * both of mán and beást.
9 He hath sent tokens and wonders into the midst of thee, O thou lánd of Égypt; * upon Pharaoh, and áll his
sérvants.
10 He smote dívers nátions, * and slew míghty kíngs:
11 Sihon, king of the Amorites; and Og, the kíng of Báshan; * and all the kíngdoms of Cánaan;
12 And gave their land to be an héritáge, * even an heritage unto Israél his peóple.
13 Thy Name, O LORD, endúreth foréver; * so doth thy memorial, O LORD, from one generation tó anóther.
14 For the LORD will avénge his peóple, * and be gracious untó his sérvants.
15 As for the images of the heathen, they are but sílver and góld; * the wórk of men’s hánds.
16 They have mouths, ánd speak nót; * eyes have they, but théy see nót.
17 They have ears, and yet théy hear nót; * neither is there any breáth in their moúths.
18 They that make them are like únto thém; * and so are all they that put their trúst in thém.
19 Praise the LORD, ye house of Ísraél; * praise the LORD, ye hoúse of Aáron.
20 Praise the LORD, ye hoúse of Lévi; * ye that fear the LORD, praíse the LÓRD.
21 Praised be the LORD oút of Síon, * who dwelleth at Jerúsalém.
22 Glory be to the Father, and tó the Són, * and to the Hóly Ghóst; 
23 As it was in the beginning, † is now, and éver sháll be, * world wíthout énd.
 Amen.

13 Who divided the Red Séa in two párts: * for his mercy endúreth foréver;
14 And made Israel to gó through the mídst of it: * for his mercy endúreth foréver.
15 But as for Pharaoh and his host,† he overthrew them ín the Red Séa: * for his mercy endúreth foréver.
16 Who led his péople through the wílderness: * for his mercy endúreth foréver.
17 Who smóte great kíngs: * for his mercy endúreth foréver;

19 Sihon, kíng of the Ámorites: * for his mercy endúreth foréver;
20 And Og, the kíng of Báshan: * for his mercy endúreth foréver;
21 And gave away their lánd for an héritage: * for his mercy endúreth foréver;
22 Even for an heritage unto Ísrael his sérvant: * for his mercy endúreth foréver.
23 Who remembered us whén we were in troúble: * for his mercy endúreth foréver;
24 And hath delivered us fróm our énemies: * for his mercy endúreth foréver.
25 Who giveth fóod to all flésh: * for his mercy endúreth foréver.
26 O give thanks unto the Gód of héaven: * for his mercy endúreth foréver.

Psalm 137. Super flumina.
BY the waters of Babylon we sát down and wépt, * when we remembered thée, O Síon.
2 As for our harps, we hánged them úp * upon the trees that áre thereín.
3 For they that led us away captive,† required of us then a song, and mélody in our héaviness: * Sing us
one of the sóngs of Síon.
4 How shall we síng the LORD’s sóng * ín a strange lánd?
5 If I forgét thee, O Jerúsalem, * let my right hand forgét her cúnning.
6 If I do not remember thee,† let my tongue cleave to the róof of my móuth; * yea, if I prefer not Jerusalem
abóve my chief jóy.
7 Remember the children of Edom, O LORD, in the dáy of Jerúsalem; * how they said, Down with it, down
with it, éven to the gróund.
8 O daughter of Babylon, wásted with mísery; * yea, happy shall he be that rewardeth thee as thóu hast
sérved us.
9 Blessed shall he be that táketh thy chíldren, * and throweth them agáinst the stónes.

I WILL give thanks unto thee, O Lord, with mý whole héart; * even before the gods will I sing práise unto

2 I will worship toward thy holy temple†, and praise thy Name, because of thy loving-kíndness and trúth; *
for thou hast magnified thy Name, and thy word, abóve all thíngs. 
3 When I called upon thee, thou héardest mé; * and enduedst my sóul with much stréngth.
4 All the kings of the earth shall práise thee, O LÓRD; * for they have heard the wórds of thy móuth.
5 Yea, they shall sing of the wáys of the LÓRD, * that great is the glóry of the LÓRD.

THE TWENTY-NINTH DAY
Morning Prayer
Psalm 139. Domine, probasti.
O LORD, thou hast searched me óut, and knówn me. * Thou knowest my down-sitting, and mine uprising;†
thou understandest my thóughts long befóre.
2 Thou art about my path, and abóut my béd; * and art acquainted with áll my wáys.
3 For lo, there is not a wórd in my tóngue, * but thou, O LORD, knówest it altogéther.
4 Thou hast beset me behínd and befóre, * and laid thine hánd upón me.
5 Such knowledge is too wonderful and éxcellent for mé; * I cannot attáin unto ít.
6 Whither shall I go then fróm thy Spírit? * or whither shall I go then fróm thy présence?
7 If I climb up into heaven, thóu art thére; * if I go down to hell, thou árt there álso.
8 If I take the wíngs of the mórning, * and remain in the uttermost párts of the séa;
9 Even there also shall thý hand léad me, * and thy ríght hand shall hóld me.
10 If I say, Peradventure the dárkness shall cóver me; * then shall my night be túrned to dáy.
11 Yea, the darkness is no darkness with thee,† but the night is as cléar as the dáy; * the darkness and light
to thee are bóth alíke.
12 For my réins are thíne; * thou hast covered me in my móther’s wómb.
13 I will give thanks unto thee, for I am fearfully and wónderfully máde: * marvelous are thy works, and
that my soul knóweth right wéll.
14 My bones are not híd from thée, * though I be made secretly, and fashioned benéath in the éarth.
15 Thine eyes did see my substance, yet béing impérfect; * and in thy book were all my mémbers wrítten;
16 Which day by dáy were fáshioned, * when as yet there was nóne of thém.
17 How dear are thy counsels unto mé, O Gód; * O how gréat is the súm of them!
18 If I tell them, they are more in númber than the sánd: * when I wake up, I am présent with thée.
19 Wilt thou not slay the wícked, O Gód? * Depart from me, ye blóodthirsty mén.
20 For they speak unríghteously agáinst thee; * and thine enemies take thy Náme in váin.
21 Do not I hate them, O LÓRD, that háte thee? * and am not I grieved with those that ríse up agáinst thee?
22 Yea, I háte them right sóre; * even as though they wére mine énemies.
23 Try me, O God, and seek the gróund of my héart; * prove me, and exámine my thóughts.
24 Look well if there be any way of wíckedness ín me; * and lead me in the wáy everlásting.
25 Glory be to the Father, and tó the Són, * and to the Hóly Ghóst;
26 As it was in the beginning, † is now, and éver sháll be, * world wíthout énd.
 Amen.
Psalm 140. Eripe me, Domine.
DELIVER me, O LORD, from the évil mán; * and preserve me from the wícked mán;
2 Who imagine míschief in their héarts, * and stir up strífe all the day lóng.
3 They have sharpened their tóngues like a sérpent; * adder’s poison is únder their líps.
4 Keep me, O LORD, from the hánds of the ungódly; * preserve me from the wicked men, who are
purposed to overthrów my góings.
5 The proud have laid a snare for me, and spread a net abróad with córds; * yea, and set tráps in my wáy.
6 I said unto the LORD, Thóu art my Gód, * hear the voice of my práyers, O LÓRD.
7 O LORD God, thou stréngth of my héalth; * thou hast covered my head in the dáy of báttle. 
8 Let not the ungodly have his desíre, O LÓRD; * let not his mischievous imagination prosper,† lest they bé
too próud.
9 Let the mischief of their own lips fall upon the héad of thém * that cómpass me abóut.
10 Let hot burning coals fáll upón them; * let them be cast into the fire,† and into the pit, that they
never rise úp agáin.
11 A man full of words shall not prosper upón the éarth: * evil shall hunt the wicked pérson to overthrów
him.
12 Sure I am that the LORD will avénge the póor, * and maintain the cáuse of the hélpless.
13 The righteous also shall give thánks unto thy Náme; * and the just shall contínue in thy síght.
14 Glory be to the Father, and tó the Són, * and to the Hóly Ghóst;
15 As it was in the beginning, † is now, and éver sháll be, * world wíthout énd.
 Amen.
Evening Prayer
Psalm 141. Domine, clamavi.
LORD, I call upon thee; haste thee únto mé, * and consider my voice, when I crý unto thée.
2 Let my prayer be set forth in thy síght as the íncense; * and let the lifting up of my hands be an évening
sácrifice.
3 Set a watch, O LORD, befóre my móuth, * and keep the dóor of my líps.
4 O let not mine heart be inclined to any évil thíng; * let me not be occupied in ungodly works with the
men that work wickedness,† neither let me eat of such thíngs as pléase them.
5 Let the righteous rather smite me fríendly, and repróve me; * yea, let not my head refuse their précious
bálms.
6 Ás for the ungódly, * I will pray yet agáinst their wíckedness.
7 Let their judges be overthrown in stóny pláces, * that they may hear my words; for théy are swéet.
8 Our bones lie scattered befóre the pít, * like as when one breaketh and heweth wóod upon the éarth.
9 But mine eyes look unto thée, O LORD Gód; * in thee is my trust; O cast not óut my sóul.
10 Keep me from the snare that they have láid for mé, * and from the traps of the wícked dóers.
11 Let the ungodly fall into their own néts togéther, * and let me éver escápe them.
12 Glory be to the Father, and tó the Són, * and to the Hóly Ghóst;
13 As it was in the beginning, † is now, and éver sháll be, * world wíthout énd.
 Amen.
Psalm 142. Voce mea ad Dominum.
I CRIED unto the LORD wíth my vóice; * yea, even unto the LORD did I máke my supplicátion.
2 I poured out my compláints befóre him, * and shówed him of my tróuble.
3 When my spirit was in heaviness, thou knéwest my páth; * in the way wherein I walked, have they privily
laid a snáre for mé.
4 I looked also upón my right hánd, * and saw there was no mán that would knów me.
5 I had no pláce to flée unto, * and no man cáred for my sóul.
6 I cried unto thee, O LÓRD, and sáid, * Thou art my hope, and my portion in the lánd of the líving.
7 Consíder my compláint; * for I am bróught very lów.
8 O deliver me fróm my pérsecutors; * for they are too stróng for mé.
9 Bring my soul out of prison, that I may give thánks unto thy Náme; * which thing if thou wilt grant me,†
then shall the righteous resort únto my cómpany.
10 Glory be to the Father, and tó the Són, * and to the Hóly Ghóst;
11 As it was in the beginning, † is now, and éver sháll be, * world wíthout énd.
 Amen.
Psalm 143. Domine, exaudi.
HEAR my prayer, O LORD, and consíder my desíre; * harken unto me for thy truth and ríghteousness’ sáke.
2 And enter not into júdgment with thy sérvant; * for in thy sight shall no man líving be jústified.
3 For the enemy hath persecuted my soul;† he hath smitten my life dówn to the gróund; * he hath laid me
in the darkness, as the men that have béen long déad.
4 Therefore is my spirit véxed withín me, * and my heart withín me is désolate. 
5 Yet do I remember the time past;† I muse upon áll thy wórks; * yea, I exercise myself in the wórks of thy
hánds.
6 I stretch forth my hánds unto thée; * my soul gaspeth unto thee as a thírsty lánd.
7 Hear me, O LORD, and that soon;† for my spirit wáxeth fáint: * hide not thy face from me, lest I be like
unto them that go dówn into the pít.
8 O let me hear thy loving-kindness betimes in the morning;† for in thée is my trúst: * show thou me the
way that I should walk in;† for I lift up my sóul unto thée.
9 Deliver me, O LÓRD, from mine enémies; * for I flee unto thée to híde me.
10 Teach me to do the thing that pleaseth thee; for thóu art my Gód: * let thy loving Spirit lead me forth
into the lánd of ríghteousness.
11 Quicken me, O LÓRD, for thy Náme’s sake; * and for thy righteousness’ sake bring my sóul out of
tróuble.
12 And of thy goodness sláy mine énemies, * and destroy all them that vex my soul; for Í am thy sérvant.
13 Glory be to the Father, and tó the Són, * and to the Hóly Ghóst;
14 As it was in the beginning, † is now, and éver sháll be, * world wíthout énd.

people that is únder mé.
3 LORD, what is man, that thou hast such respéct unto hím? * or the son of man, that thóu so regárdest him?
4 Man is like a thíng of nóught; * his time passeth awáy like a shádow.
5 Bow thy heavens, O LÓRD, and come dówn; * touch the mountains, and théy shall smóke.
6 Cast forth thy líghtning, and téar them; * shoot out thine árrows, and consúme them.
7 Send down thine hánd from abóve; * deliver me,† and take me out of the great waters, from the hánd of
strángers;
8 Whose mouth tálketh of vánity, * and their right hand is a ríght hand of wíckedness.
9 I will sing a new song unto thée, O Gód; * and sing praises unto thee upon a tén-stringed lúte.
10 Thou hast given víctory unto kíngs, * and hast delivered David thy servant from the péril of the swórd.
11 Save me, and deliver me from the hánd of strángers, * whose mouth talketh of vanity,† and their right
hand is a ríght hand of iníquity:
12 That our sons may grow úp as the young plánts, * and that our daughters may be as the polished córners
of the témple;
13 That our garners may be full and plenteous with all mánner of stóre; * that our sheep may bring forth
thousands, and ten thóusands in our fíelds;
14 That our oxen may be strong to labor;† that there bé no decáy, * no leading into captivity, and no
compláining in our stréets.
15 Happy are the people that are in súch a cáse; * yea, blessed are the people who have the LÓRD for their
Gód.
16 Glory be to the Father, and tó the Són, * and to the Hóly Ghóst;
17 As it was in the beginning, † is now, and éver sháll be, * world wíthout énd.
 Amen.

12 That thy power, thy glory, and míghtiness of thy kíngdom, * might be knówn unto mén.
13 Thy kingdom is an éverlasting kíngdom, * and thy dominion endureth throughóut all áges.
14 The LORD upholdeth áll such as fáll, * and lifteth up all thóse that are dówn.
15 The eyes of all wait upón thee, O LÓRD; * and thou givest them their méat in due séason.
16 Thou ópenest thine hánd, * and fillest all things líving with plénteousness.
17 The LORD is righteous in áll his wáys, * and holy in áll his wórks.

4 Blessed is he that hath the God of Jácob for his hélp, * and whose hope is in the LÓRD his Gód:
5 Who made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that thérein ís; * who keepeth his prómise foréver;
6 Who helpeth them to right that súffer wróng; * who féedeth the húngry.
7 The LORD looseth mén out of príson; * the LORD giveth síght to the blínd.
8 The LORD helpeth thém that are fállen; * the LORD cáreth for the ríghteous.
9 The LORD careth for the strangers;† he defendeth the fátherless and wídow: * as for the way of the
ungodly, he turneth it úpside dówn.
10 The LORD thy God, O Sion, shall be Kíng forévermóre, * and throughout áll generátions.
11 Glory be to the Father, and tó the Són, * and to the Hóly Ghóst;

Psalm 147. Laudate Dominum.
PRAISE the LORD, for it is a good thing to sing praises únto our Gód; * yea, a joyful and pleasant thing it ís
to be thánkful.
2 The LORD doth búild up Jerúsalem, * and gather together the óutcasts of Ísrael.
3 He healeth those that are bróken in héart, * and giveth medicine to héal their síckness.

8 Who covereth the heaven with clouds, and prepareth ráin for the éarth; * and maketh the grass to grow
upon the mountains,† and herb for the úse of mén;
9 Who giveth fodder únto the cáttle, * and feedeth the young ravens that cáll upón him.
10 He hath no pleasure in the stréngth of an hórse; * neither delighteth he in ány man’s légs.
11 But the LORD’s delight is in thém that fear hím, * and put their trúst in his mércy.
12 Praise the LÓRD, O Jerúsalem; * praise thy Gód, O Síon.
13 For he hath made fast the bárs of thy gátes, * and hath blessed thy chíldren withín thee.
14 He maketh péace in thy bórders, * and filleth thee with the flóur of whéat.
15 He sendeth forth his commándment upon éarth, * and his word rúnneth very swíftly.
16 He giveth snów like wóol, * and scattereth the hóarfrost like áshes.
17 He casteth forth his íce like mórsels: * who is able to abíde his fróst?
18 He sendeth out his word, and mélteth thém: * he bloweth with his wind, and the wáters flów.
19 He showeth his wórd unto Jácob, * his statutes and ordinances únto Ísrael.
20 He hath not dealt so with ány nátion; * neither have the heathen knówledge of his láws.
21 Glory be to the Father, and tó the Són, * and to the Hóly Ghóst; 
22 As it was in the beginning, † is now, and éver sháll be, * world wíthout énd.
