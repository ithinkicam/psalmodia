  "text": "BE thou my Judge, O LORD, for I have walked innocently: *\nmy trust hath been also in the LORD, therefore shall I not fall.\n2 Examine me, O LORD, and prove me; *\ntry out my reins and my heart.\n3 For thy loving-kindness is ever before mine eyes; *\nand I will walk in thy truth.\n4 I have not dwelt with vain persons; *\nneither will I have fellowship with the deceitful.\n5 I have hated the congregation of the wicked; *\nand will not sit among the ungodly.\n6 I will wash my hands in innocency, O LORD; *\nand so will I go to thine altar;\n7 That I may show the voice of thanksgiving, *\nand tell of all thy wondrous works.\n8 LORD, I have loved the habitation of thy house, *\nand the place where thine honor dwelleth.\n9 O shut not up my soul with the sinners, *\nnor my life with the blood-thirsty;\n10 In whose hands is wickedness, *\nand their right hand is full of gifts.\n11 But as for me, I will walk innocently: *\nO deliver me, and be merciful unto me.\n12 My foot standeth right: *\nI will praise the LORD in the congregations.\n13 Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, *\nand to the Holy Ghost;\n14 As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be, *\nworld without end. Amen."
