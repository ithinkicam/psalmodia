  "text": "I SAID, I will take heed to my ways, *\nthat I offend not in my tongue.\n2 I will keep my mouth as it were with a bridle, *\nwhile the ungodly is in my sight.\n3 I held my tongue, and spake nothing: *\nI kept silence, yea, even from good words; but it was pain and grief to me.\n4 My heart was hot within me; and while I was thus musing the fire kindled, *\nand at the last I spake with my tongue:\n5 LORD, let me know mine end, and the number of my days; *\nthat I may be certified how long I have to live.\n6 Behold, thou hast made my days as it were a span long; *\nand mine age is even as nothing in respect of thee; and verily every man living is altogether vanity.\n7 For man walketh in a vain shadow, and disquieteth himself in vain: *\nhe heapeth up riches, and cannot tell who shall gather them.\n8 And now, Lord, what is my hope? *\ntruly my hope is even in thee.\n9 Deliver me from all mine offenses; *\nand make me not a rebuke unto the foolish.\n10 I became dumb, and opened not my mouth; *\nfor it was thy doing.\n11 Take thy plague away from me: *\nI am even consumed by the means of thy heavy hand.\n12 When thou with rebukes dost chasten man for sin, thou makest his beauty to consume away, like as it were a moth fretting a garment: *\nevery man therefore is but vanity.\n13 Hear my prayer, O LORD, and with thine ears consider my calling; *\nhold not thy peace at my tears;\n14 For I am a stranger with thee, and a sojourner, *\nas all my fathers were.\n15 O spare me a little, that I may recover my strength, *\nbefore I go hence, and be no more seen.\n16 Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, *\nand to the Holy Ghost;\n17 As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be, *\nworld without end. Amen."
