  "text": "GIVE sentence with me, O God, and defend my cause against the ungodly people; *\nO deliver me from the deceitful and wicked man.\n2 For thou art the God of my strength; why hast thou put me from thee? *\nand why go I so heavily, while the enemy oppresseth me?\n3 O send out thy light and thy truth, that they may lead me, *\nand bring me unto thy holy hill, and to thy dwelling;\n4 And that I may go unto the altar of God, even unto the God of my joy and gladness; *\nand upon the harp will I give thanks unto thee, O God, my God.\n5 Why art thou so heavy, O my soul? *\nand why art thou so disquieted within me?\n6 O put thy trust in God; *\nfor I will yet give him thanks, which is the help of my countenance, and my God.\n7 Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, *\nand to the Holy Ghost;\n8 As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be, *\nworld without end. Amen."
