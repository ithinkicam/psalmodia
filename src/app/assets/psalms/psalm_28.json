  "text": "UNTO thee will I cry, O LORD my strength; *\nthink no scorn of me; lest, if thou make as though thou hearest not, I become like them that go down into the pit.\n2 Hear the voice of my humble petitions, when I cry unto thee; *\nwhen I hold up my hands toward the mercy-seat of thy holy temple.\n3 O pluck me not away, neither destroy me, with the ungodly and wicked doers, *\nwhich speak friendly to their neighbors, but imagine mischief in their hearts.\n4 Reward them according to their deeds, *\nand according to the wickedness of their own inventions.\n5 Recompense them after the work of their hands; *\npay them that they have deserved.\n6 For they regard not in their mind the works of the LORD, nor the operation of his hands; *\ntherefore shall he break them down, and not build them up.\n7 Praised be the LORD; *\nfor he hath heard the voice of my humble petitions.\n8 The LORD is my strength, and my shield; my heart hath trusted in him, and I am helped; *\ntherefore my heart danceth for joy, and in my song will I praise him.\n9 The LORD is my strength, *\nand he is the wholesome defense of his Anointed.\n10 O save thy people, and give thy blessing unto thine inheritance: *\nfeed them, and set them up for ever.\n11 Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, *\nand to the Holy Ghost;\n12 As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be, *\nworld without end. Amen."
