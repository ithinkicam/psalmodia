  "text": "MY heart showeth me the wickedness of the ungodly, *\nthat there is no fear of God before his eyes.\n2 For he flattereth himself in his own sight, *\nuntil his abominable sin be found out.\n3 The words of his mouth are unrighteous and full of deceit: *\nhe hath left off to behave himself wisely, and to do good.\n4 He imagineth mischief upon his bed, and hath set himself in no good way: *\nneither doth he abhor any thing that is evil.\n5 Thy mercy, O LORD, reacheth unto the heavens, *\nand thy faithfulness unto the clouds.\n6 Thy righteousness standeth like the strong mountains: *\nthy judgments are like the great deep.\n7 Thou, LORD, shalt save both man and beast; how excellent is thy mercy, O God! *\nand the children of men shall put their trust under the shadow of thy wings.\n8 They shall be satisfied with the plenteousness of thy house; *\nand thou shalt give them drink of thy pleasures, as out of the river.\n9 For with thee is the well of life; *\nand in thy light shall we see light.\n10 O continue forth thy loving-kindness unto them that know thee, *\nand thy righteousness unto them that are true of heart.\n11 O let not the foot of pride come against me; *\nand let not the hand of the ungodly cast me down.\n12 There are they fallen, all that work wickedness; *\nthey are cast down, and shall not be able to stand.\n13 Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, *\nand to the Holy Ghost;\n14 As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be, *\nworld without end. Amen."
