  "text": "I WILL magnify thee, O LORD; for thou hast set me up, *\nand not made my foes to triumph over me.\n2 O LORD my God, I cried unto thee; *\nand thou hast healed me.\n3 Thou, LORD, hast brought my soul out of hell: *\nthou hast kept my life, that I should not go down into the pit.\n4 Sing praises unto the LORD, O ye saints of his; *\nand give thanks unto him for a remembrance of his holiness.\n5 For his wrath endureth but the twinkling of an eye, and in his pleasure is life: *\nheaviness may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning.\n6 And in my prosperity I said, I shall never be removed: *\nthou, LORD, of thy goodness, hast made my hill so strong.\n7 Thou didst turn thy face from me, *\nand I was troubled.\n8 Then cried I unto thee, O LORD; *\nand gat me to my LORD right humbly.\n9 What profit is there in my blood, *\nwhen I go down into the pit?\n10 Shall the dust give thanks unto thee? *\nor shall it declare thy truth?\n11 Hear, O LORD, and have mercy upon me; *\nLORD, be thou my helper.\n12 Thou hast turned my heaviness into joy: *\nthou hast put off my sackcloth, and girded me with gladness.\n13 Therefore shall every good man sing of thy praise without ceasing: *\nO my God, I will give thanks unto thee for ever.\n14 Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, *\nand to the Holy Ghost;\n15 As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be, *\nworld without end. Amen."
