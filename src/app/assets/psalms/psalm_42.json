  "text": "LIKE as the hart desireth the water-brooks, *\nso longeth my soul after thee, O God.\n2 My soul is athirst for God, yea, even for the living God: *\nwhen shall I come to appear before the presence of God?\n3 My tears have been my meat day and night, *\nwhile they daily say unto me, Where is now thy God?\n4 Now when I think thereupon, I pour out my heart by myself; *\nfor I went with the multitude, and brought them forth into the house of God;\n5 In the voice of praise and thanksgiving, *\namong such as keep holy-day.\n6 Why art thou so full of heaviness, O my soul? *\nand why art thou so disquieted within me?\n7 Put thy trust in God; *\nfor I will yet give him thanks for the help of his countenance.\n8 My God, my soul is vexed within me; *\ntherefore will I remember thee concerning the land of Jordan, and the little hill of Hermon.\n9 One deep calleth another, because of the noise of the water-pipes; *\nall thy waves and storms are gone over me.\n10 The LORD hath granted his loving-kindness in the day-time; *\nand in the night-season did I sing of him, and made my prayer unto the God of my life.\n11 I will say unto the God of my strength, Why hast thou forgotten me? *\nwhy go I thus heavily, while the enemy oppresseth me?\n12 My bones are smitten asunder as with a sword, *\nwhile mine enemies that trouble me cast me in the teeth;\n13 Namely, while they say daily unto me, *\nWhere is now thy God?\n14 Why art thou so vexed, O my soul? *\nand why art thou so disquieted within me?\n15 O put thy trust in God; *\nfor I will yet thank him, which is the help of my countenance, and my God.\n16 Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, *\nand to the Holy Ghost;\n17 As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be, *\nworld without end. Amen."
