  "text": "THE heavens declare the glóry of Gód; *\nand the firmament showeth his hándy-wórk.\n2 One day telleth another; *\nand one night certifieth anóther.\n3 There is neither speech nor language; *\nbut their voices are héard amóng them.\n4 Their sound is gone out into all lands; *\nand their words into the énds of the wórld.\n5 In them hath he set a tabernacle for the sun; *\nwhich cometh forth as a bridegroom out of his chamber,†\nand rejoiceth as a giant to rún his cóurse.\n6 It goeth forth from the uttermost part of the heaven,†\nand runneth about unto the énd of it agáin; *\nand there is nothing hid from the héat theréof.\n7 The law of the LORD is an undefiled law,†\nconverting the sóul; *\nthe testimony of the LORD is sure, and giveth wisdom unto the símple.\n8 The statutes of the LORD are right,†\nand rejoice the héart; *\nthe commandment of the LORD is pure, and giveth light unto the éyes.\n9 The fear of the LORD is clean,†\nand endureth foréver; *\nthe judgments of the LORD are true, and righteous altogéther.\n10 More to be desired are they than gold,†\nyea, than much fine góld; *\nsweeter also than honey, and the hóney-cómb.\n11 Moreover, by them is thy servant táught; *\nand in keeping of them there is great rewárd.\n12 Who can tell how oft he óffendeth? *\nO cleanse thou me from my sécret fáults.\n13 Keep thy servant also from presumptuous sins,†\nlest they get the domínion over mé; *\nso shall I be undefiled, and innocent from the great óffense.\n14 Let the words of my mouth, and the meditation of my heart,†\nbe alway acceptable in thy síght, *\nO LORD, my strength, and my redéemer.\n15 Glory be to the Father, and tó the Són, *\nand to the Hóly Ghóst;\n16 As it was in the beginning, †\nis now, and éver sháll be, *\nworld wíthout énd. Amen."
