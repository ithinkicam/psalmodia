  "text": "BLESSED is he that considereth the poor and needy; *\nthe LORD shall deliver him in the time of trouble.\n2 The LORD preserve him, and keep him alive, that he may be blessed upon earth; *\nand deliver not thou him into the will of his enemies.\n3 The LORD comfort him when he lieth sick upon his bed; *\nmake thou all his bed in his sickness.\n4 I said, LORD, be merciful unto me; *\nheal my soul, for I have sinned against thee.\n5 Mine enemies speak evil of me, *\nWhen shall he die, and his name perish?\n6 And if he come to see me, he speaketh vanity, *\nand his heart conceiveth falsehood within himself; and when he cometh forth, he telleth it.\n7 All mine enemies whisper together against me; *\neven against me do they imagine this evil.\n8 Let the sentence of guiltiness proceed against him; *\nand now that he lieth, let him rise up no more.\n9 Yea, even mine own familiar friend, whom I trusted, *\nwho did also eat of my bread, hath laid great wait for me.\n10 But be thou merciful unto me, O LORD; *\nraise thou me up again, and I shall reward them.\n11 By this I know thou favourest me, *\nthat mine enemy doth not triumph against me.\n12 And when I am in my health, thou upholdest me; *\nand shalt set me before thy face for ever.\n13 Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, *\nworld without end. Amen.\n14 Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, *\nand to the Holy Ghost;\n15 As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be, *\nworld without end. Amen."
