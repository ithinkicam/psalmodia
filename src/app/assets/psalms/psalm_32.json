  "text": "BLESSED is he whose unrighteousness is forgiven, *\nand whose sin is covered.\n2 Blessed is the man unto whom the LORD imputeth no sin, *\nand in whose spirit there is no guile.\n3 For while I held my tongue, *\nmy bones consumed away through my daily complaining.\n4 For thy hand was heavy upon me day and night, *\nand my moisture was like the drought in summer.\n5 I acknowledged my sin unto thee; *\nand mine unrighteousness have I not hid.\n6 I said, I will confess my sins unto the LORD; *\nand so thou forgavest the wickedness of my sin.\n7 For this shall every one that is godly make his prayer unto thee, in a time when thou mayest be found; *\nbut in the great water-floods they shall not come nigh him.\n8 Thou art a place to hide me in; thou shalt preserve me from trouble; *\nthou shalt compass me about with songs of deliverance.\n9 I will inform thee, and teach thee in the way wherein thou shalt go; *\nand I will guide thee with mine eye.\n10 Be ye not like to horse and mule, which have no understanding; *\nwhose mouths must be held with bit and bridle, else they will not obey thee.\n11 Great plagues remain for the ungodly; *\nbut whoso putteth his trust in the LORD, mercy embraceth him on every side.\n12 Be glad, O ye righteous, and rejoice in the LORD; *\nand be joyful, all ye that are true of heart.\n13 Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, *\nand to the Holy Ghost;\n14 As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be, *\nworld without end. Amen."
