  "text": "THE King shall rejoice in thy strength, O LORD; *\nexceeding glad shall he be of thy salvátion.\n2 Thou hast given him his heart’s desíre, *\nand hast not denied him the request of his líps.\n3 For thou shalt prevent him with the blessings of góodness, *\nand shalt set a crown of pure gold upón his héad.\n4 He asked life of thee; and thou gavest him a long lífe, *\neven for éver and éver.\n5 His honor is great in thy salvátion; *\nglory and great worship shalt thou láy upón him.\n6 For thou shalt give him everlasting félicity, *\nand make him glad with the joy of thy cóuntenance.\n7 And why? because the King putteth his trust in the LORD; *\nand in the mercy of the Most Highest he shall not míscarry.\n8 All thine enemies shall feel thine hánd; *\nthy right hand shall find out them that háte thee.\n9 Thou shalt make them like a fiery oven in time of thy wrath; *\nthe LORD shall destroy them in his displeasure, and the fire shall consúme them.\n10 Their fruit shalt thou root out of the éarth, *\nand their seed from among the chíldren of mén.\n11 For they intended míschief agáinst thee, *\nand imagined such a device as they are not able to perfórm.\n12 Therefore shalt thou put them to flight, *\nand the strings of thy bow shalt thou make ready agáinst the fáce of them.\n13 Be thou exalted, LORD, in thine own strength; *\nso will we sing, and praise thy pówer.\n14 Glory be to the Father, and tó the Són, *\nand to the Hóly Ghóst;\n15 As it was in the beginning, †\nis now, and éver sháll be, *\nworld wíthout énd. Amen."
