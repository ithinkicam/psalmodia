  "text": "PRESERVE me, O God; *\nfor in thee have I put my trúst.\n2 O my soul, thou hast said unto the LORD,†\nThou art my Gód; *\nmy goods are nothing únto thée.\n3 All my delight is upon the sáints that are ín the earth, *\nand upon such as excél in vírtue.\n4 But they that run after another god†\nshall have great tróuble. *\nTheir drink-offerings of blood will I not offer,†\nneither make mention of their names withín my líps.\n5 The LORD himself is the portion of mine inheritance,†\nand of my cúp; *\nthou shalt maintain my lót.\n6 The lot is fallen unto me in a fair ground; *\nyea, I have a goodly héritage.\n7 I will thank the LORD for giving me wárning; *\nmy reins also chasten me in the níght-séason.\n8 I have set the LORD álways befóre me; *\nfor he is on my right hand, therefore Í shall not fáll.\n9 Wherefore my heart is glad, and my glóry rejóiceth: *\nmy flesh also shall rest in hópe.\n10 For why? thou shalt not leave my soul in hél; *\nneither shalt thou suffer thy Holy One to sée corrúption.\n11 Thou shalt show me the path of life;†\nin thy presence is the fulness of jóy, *\nand at thy right hand there is pleasure for évermóre.\n12 Glory be to the Father, and tó the Són, *\nand to the Hóly Ghóst;\n13 As it was in the beginning, †\nis now, and éver sháll be, *\nworld wíthout énd. Amen."
