  "text": "THE LORD is my light and my salvation; whom then shall I fear? *\nthe LORD is the strength of my life; of whom then shall I be afraid?\n2 When the wicked, even mine enemies and my foes, came upon me to eat up my flesh, *\nthey stumbled and fell.\n3 Though an host of men were laid against me, yet shall not my heart be afraid; *\nand though there rose up war against me, yet will I put my trust in him.\n4 One thing have I desired of the LORD, which I will require; *\neven that I may dwell in the house of the LORD all the days of my life,\n5 To behold the fair beauty of the LORD, *\nand to visit his temple.\n6 For in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his tabernacle; *\nyea, in the secret place of his dwelling shall he hide me, and set me up upon a rock of stone.\n7 And now shall he lift up mine head *\nabove mine enemies round about me.\n8 Therefore will I offer in his dwelling an oblation with great gladness: *\nI will sing, and speak praises unto the LORD.\n9 Hearken unto my voice, O LORD, when I cry unto thee; *\nhave mercy upon me, and hear me.\n10 My heart hath talked of thee, Seek ye my face: *\nThy face, LORD, will I seek.\n11 O hide not thou thy face from me, *\nnor cast thy servant away in displeasure.\n12 Thou hast been my succor; *\nleave me not, neither forsake me, O God of my salvation.\n13 When my father and my mother forsake me, *\nthe LORD taketh me up.\n14 Teach me thy way, O LORD, *\nand lead me in the right way, because of mine enemies.\n15 Deliver me not over into the will of mine adversaries: *\nfor there are false witnesses risen up against me, and such as speak wrong.\n16 I should utterly have fainted, *\nbut that I believe verily to see the goodness of the LORD in the land of the living.\n17 O tarry thou the LORD’s leisure; *\nbe strong, and he shall comfort thine heart; and put thou thy trust in the LORD.\n18 Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, *\nand to the Holy Ghost;\n19 As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be, *\nworld without end. Amen."
