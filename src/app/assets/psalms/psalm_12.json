  "text": "HELP me, LORD, for there is not one gódly man léft; *\nfor the faithful are minished from among the chíldren of mén.\n2 They talk of vanity every óne with his néighbor; *\nthey do but flatter with their lips, and dissemble in their dóuble héart.\n3 The LORD shall root out all decéitful líps, *\nand the tongue that speaketh próud thíngs;\n4 Which have said, With our tóngue will we preváil; *\nwe are they that ought to speak; who is lórd over ús?\n5 Now, for the comfortless troubles’ sáke of the néedy, *\nand because of the deep síghing of the póor,\n6 I will up, sáith the LORD;†\nand will help every one from him that swélleth against him, *\nand will sét him at rést.\n7 The words of the LORD are pure wórds;†\neven as the silver which from the éarth is tríed, *\nand purified seven times ín the fíre.\n8 Thou shalt keep thém, O LORD; *\nthou shalt preserve them from this generátion foréver.\n9 The ungodly walk on évery síde: *\nwhen they are exalted, the children of men are pút to rebúke.\n10 Glory be to the Father, and tó the Són, *\nand to the Hóly Ghóst;\n11 As it was in the beginning, †\nis now, and éver sháll be, *\nworld wíthout énd. Amen."
