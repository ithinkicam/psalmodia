  "text": "BLESSED is the man that hath not walked in the counsel of the ungodly †\nnor stood in the wáy of sínners,\n*\nand hath not sat in the séat of the scórnful.\n2 But his delight is in the láw of the LORD ; *\nand in his law will he exercise himself dáy and níght.\n3 And he shall be like a tree plánted by the wáterside,\n*\nthat will bring forth his frúit in due séason.\n4 His leaf also sháll not wíther; *\nand look, whatsoever he doeth, ít shall prósper.\n5 As for the ungodly, it is nót so with thém; *\nbut they are like the chaff, which the wind scattereth away from the fáce of the éarth.\n6 Therefore the ungodly shall not be able to stánd in the júdgment,\n*\nneither the sinners in the congregátion of the ríghteous.\n7 But the LORD knoweth the wáy of the ríghteous; *\nand the way of the ungódly shall pérish.\n8 Glory be to the Father, and tó the Són,\n*\nand to the Hóly Ghóst;\n9 As it was in the beginning, †\nis now, and éver sháll be,\n*\nworld wíthout énd. Amen."
